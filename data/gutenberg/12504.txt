To Thomas Frederick Crane, A.M., Of Cornell University, Whose Profound Scholarship, Inspiring Teachings, And Lasting Friendship Are Here Gratefully Acknowledged.
That so typical a representative of eighteenth century society, so gracious a personality, so charming a writer, and so superior a genius as Marivaux should be not only unedited, but practically unknown to the American reading public, is a matter of surprise.
His brilliant comedies, written in an easy prose, and free from all impurities of thought or expression, offer peculiarly attractive texts for our classes.
It is for these reasons that this edition was undertaken.
Briasson, deux vols.).
It has not seemed wise to retain the curious orthography of these early editions, as the explanation of the same would uselessly burden the notes, and possibly confuse the student.
An orthography following the same lines as that of the edition of les Grands Ecrivains has been adopted.
The Introduction is rather extensive, but, as it serves in truth as an introduction to students in American schools of an author as yet little known, a less minute statement of his qualifications would hardly have been pardonable.
In fact, the Introduction does not claim to be so much a literary essay as a compilation of authorities.
The notes to a text containing no historical, literary, or biographical allusions are naturally limited to explaining the difficulties of the French, and are less extensive than would otherwise be required.
Words and idioms, which, though unusual or difficult, can be found in any of the small dictionaries accessible to students, have been excluded from the notes as unnecessary, except such as might mislead unless explained, or such as differ from the modern use.
It remains for the editor to acknowledge his indebtedness for sympathetic interest and valuable suggestions to Gustave Larroumet, professor of French Literature at the University of Paris, and perpetual secretary of the Academie des Beaux Arts, to Professor Crane and Mr.
Guerlac of Cornell University, and to Professor de Sumichrast of Harvard.
January neuf, mille neuf cent un.
Among the treasures of the Comedie-Francaise, interesting alike to students of letters and of art, is a painting by Vanloo.
It bears the date of mille sept cent cinquante-trois, and represents a man of doubtful age--for it is hard to tell whether he is past his prime or not--yet, if the truth were known, one could not write him down for less than sixty-five.
The face is life-like and attractive, full of an expression of gentle breeding, kindliness, wit, and subtlety.
The eyes are rather dark, large, fine, and keen; with the thin lips, pursed in a half-smile, they form the most striking features of the countenance, and serve to give it that characteristic of finesse so peculiar to the man.
The date of his birth was February quatre, mille six cent quatre-vingt-huit, a year noteworthy as introducing to the public the first edition of the Caracteres of La Bruyere, with whom Marivaux has often been compared.
His father was of an old Norman family, which had had representatives in the parlement of that province.
Since then the family had "descended from the robe to finance," following the expression of d'Alembert.
Ennobled by the robe, they had assumed the name de Chamblain, but unfortunately the latter name was common to certain financiers, and, to still better distinguish themselves, the family had adopted the additional name of Marivaux.
There seems, however, to have been no connection between them and the lords of Marivaux (or Marivaulx), a branch of the house of l'Isle-Adam.
Our author signed, himself de Marivaux or Carlet de Marivaux.
His childhood was passed at Riom in Auvergne, where his father had been appointed director of the Mint.
Gossot declares that Marivaux was six years of age when he was taken to Riom, but does not give his authority for the statement.
It is certain, however, that he was so young at the time that some of his contemporaries supposed he had been born there.
Marivaux received his early education at Riom, and later at Limoges, where the family went to dwell, and where his father was perhaps again connected with the Mint.
His biographers differ with regard to the education he received.
D'Alembert follows the testimony of Palissot and others, although he confesses that they are "in truth very ill disposed" towards Marivaux, and adds that perhaps they have very unjustly accused him of ignorance of Latin.
Their pardoning him his lack of knowledge of Greek, d'Alembert cleverly ascribes to that "indulgent equity" which does not require of one's fellows that which one lacks himself.
Marivaux describes the incident in the first feuille of the Spectateur francais, and, inasmuch as the sketch gives an excellent idea of the man, un translate it in full.
"At the age of seventeen un became attached to a young girl, to whom un owe the sort of life which un adopted.
un was not uncomely then, un had a mild disposition and affectionate ways.
The decorum which un noticed in the girl had drawn my attention to her beauty.
un found in her, moreover, so much indifference to her charms, that un would have sworn she was ignorant of them.
Were she seated or standing, speaking or walking, it always seemed to me that she was absolutely artless, and that she thought of nothing less than appearing to be what she was.
"One day in the country, when un had just left her, a forgotten glove caused me to retrace my steps to get it.
She, in turn, perceived me in the mirror, and blushed.
His connection with the salons of Paris, where so much of his life was spent in the society of women, probably contributed largely to develop those traits that were doubtless innate.
With something of the coquette in his own nature, Marivaux had no patience with it in others.
D'Alembert relates another incident, which will serve to show that not only affectation, but also everything that seemed to him too studied, received his condemnation.
"One day, he went to see a man from whom he had received many letters, which were almost in his own style, and, which, as one may well imagine, had seemed to him very ingenious.
Not finding him, he determined to wait.
He noticed, by chance, on the desk of this man, the rough draughts of the letters which he had received from him, and which he supposed had been written off-hand.
Here are rough draughts, said he, which do him no credit: henceforth, he may make minutes of his letters for whomsoever he likes, but he shall receive no more of mine.
Upon being challenged to prove his point, he set to work, and, a few days later, brought to the company a comedy in one act, entitled le Pere prudent et equitable, ou Crispin l'heureux fourbe.
He did well to keep this comedy from the public, for it contained little that gave promise of genius, being juvenile in character, dull and faulty in versification, and largely, though poorly, imitated from Moliere and Regnard.
It must have been shortly after this that Marivaux returned to Paris to continue his studies, and possibly to prepare himself for the life of a literary dilettante.
His means were sufficient to enable him to indulge his taste in this way.
Here we find him admitted to the salon of Mme.
de Lambert, held in her famous apartments, situated at the corner of the rue Richelieu and the rue Colbert, and now replaced by a portion of the Bibliotheque Nationale.
It was a rendezvous of select society on Wednesdays, and particularly of the literary set on Tuesdays, and among its habitues may be mentioned such men as Fontenelle, d'Argenson, Sainte- Aulaire, La Motte, and President Henault.
The envious dubbed it un bureau d'esprit, and its form of preciosite, lambertinage.
That Mme.
de Lambert had a great influence in forming the mind of the young author no one can read his works and doubt.
A "precieuse in the most flattering and most exact acceptation" of the term, she promoted a similar turn of mind in Marivaux.
His dislike for Moliere may have received its encouragement from her, as she was never quite willing to forgive that great genius for his attack upon les femmes savantes.
Marivaux, too, had, as Palissot expresses it, "un faible pour les precieuses," and for the author of those famous attacks, a contempt as unfeigned as absurd.
The high moral character of his writings and his ideas on marriage and children may readily have found their origin with Mme.
de Lambert.
de Tencin, to whose salon of the rue Saint-Honore Marivaux was likewise welcomed, was as different a character from the kindly, serious, upright, and judicious Mme.
de Lambert as can well be imagined, and it was only after the death of the latter, in mille sept cent trente-trois, that her salon was particularly brilliant.
Her youth had been most disorderly.
At an early age she had assumed the veil, but, through the efforts of her brother, the abbe de Tencin, and later cardinal, who, doubtless, saw in her a powerful factor for his own promotion, she obtained her secularization.
The latter was the father of her son, whom she abandoned on the steps of the church Saint-Jean-le-Rond, and who, reared by a glazier's wife, became the celebrated d'Alembert.
Another lover, Lafresnaye, whom she had induced to put all of his property in her name, shot himself, or was shot, at her house.
Although imprisoned on suspicion at the Chatelet, and later at the Bastille, she soon gained her liberty by the intervention of powerful friends.
That she could maintain her position in society as she did is a striking proof of its terribly corrupt condition.
In her declining years she sought to veil the disorders of her youth by more serious pursuits, and gathered about her a number of literary spirits of whom she spoke as her betes or her menagerie.
Marmontel gives the following description of the habitues of her salon and of the desire that pervaded all to show their wit: "L'auditoire etait respectable.
de Tencin ...
je m'apercus bientot qu'on y arrivait prepare a jouer son role, et que l'envie d'entrer en scene n'y laissait pas toujours a la conversation la liberte de suivre son cours facile et naturel.
C'etait a qui saisirait le plus vite, et comme a la volee, le moment de placer son mot, son conte, son anecdote, sa maxime ou son trait leger et piquant; et, pour amener l'a-propos, on le tirait quelquefois d'un peu loin.
Dans Marivaux, l'impatience de faire preuve de finesse et de sagacite percait visiblement." Marivaux, in describing the feelings of Marianne upon being introduced into polite society at the home of Mme.
Dorsin, makes an evident allusion to the salon of Mme.
de Tencin, and shows how differently from Marmontel he regarded the spirit that marked those gatherings.
The description of Mme.
Dorsin is that of Mme.
de Tencin herself, seen through the eyes of an enthusiastic friend, and she knew the art of gaining friends, and of keeping them, too.
In fact, she was never weary of doing for them, as Marivaux had reason to know as well as any of them, and, had it not been for her efforts, he would never have belonged to the French Academy.
Her judgment of the literary productions of her friends was most unprejudiced and judicious, so that whatever met with an enthusiastic reception in her salon was reasonably certain of success in the world.
After the death of Mme.
de Tencin, in mille sept cent quarante-neuf, Marivaux frequented the mercredis of the bonne maman Geoffrin, and, through friendship for her, sustained the candidature of Marmontel for the French Academy.
However, he must have felt ill at ease in company with the philosophers and encylopedists who gave dignity to her salon, and, with his love of admiration, must have sighed for the days when he shone so brilliantly in the circle that surrounded Mme.
de Lambert or Mme.
de Tencin; and, perhaps in sheer desperation, was led to seek in the salons of the brilliant but discontented Mme.
du Deffand, of that poet too highly valued by her contemporaries, Mme.
du Bocage, and of the actress Mlle.
Quinault cadette, that form of preciosite for which his mind was suited, and which he never found again, because he had outlived the fashion.
Marmontel, in describing the society that frequented the salon of Mme.
He would agree that such a thing was true up to a certain point or under a certain aspect; but there was always some restriction, some distinction to be made, which he alone had perceived.
This labor of attention was hard for him, often painful for the others; but sometimes there resulted from it happy observations and brilliant hits.
However, by the anxiety of his glances, one could see that he was uneasy about the success that he was having or might have.
This timidity of his explains his fear of being duped by the ingenue of Limoges, as well as his mistrust of the man who made rough draughts of his letters, instead of writing them off-hand.
That Marivaux was over- sensitive we must agree, for, although the testimony of his contemporaries may be somewhat biased by jealousy, it is too overwhelmingly unanimous to be gainsaid.
He had confided to Mme.
Geoffrin a certain grievance against Marmontel.
She, in turn, spoke to the latter of the fancied slight, although she assured him that, even in his complaints, Marivaux spoke only well of him, a small matter, but one that proves the nobility of our author's nature.
When the occasion presented itself, Marmontel asked for an explanation of his grievance, and, with some difficulty, elicited the following reply: "Have you forgotten that at the house of Mme.
du Bocage, one evening, being seated near Mme.
He had made his debut, as has been said, with le Pere prudent in mille sept cent six.
This was followed a few years later by three mediocre novels.
de Scudery.
It must not be considered a parody, but rather a weak imitation of Cervantes' Don Quijote.
He was no more successful in les Aventures de..., ou les Effets surprenants de la sympathie (mille sept cent treize-mille sept cent quatorze), written, in much the same style, or in la Voiture embourbee, which appeared between the two publications of the former.
This latter follows a familiar device: that is to say, one of the personages of the main narrative begins a story.
which is continued by another when he reaches the end of his imagination, and so on.
In mille sept cent dix-sept he allied himself with le Nouveau Mercure, a paper devoted to the interests of the Modernes as against those of the Anciens.
Dacier, and followers strenuously upheld the honor of antiquity, had dragged on through the seventeenth and into the eighteenth century, until apparently the last word had been said by Mme.
Dacier in her Preface a la traduction de l'Odyssee (mille sept cent seize).
Marivaux, however, by turn of mind and training a modern, and ever the champion of his friend La Motte, and, perhaps more to avenge him for the "grosses paroles de Mme.
Dacier" than to depreciate le divin Homere (whom he made a point of always mentioning in that way), would not let the matter rest, and, in mille sept cent dix-sept, composed a burlesque poem entitled l'Iliade ravestie.
Had he been familiar with the Greek language, he might never have committed this piece of literary impudence, but he knew Homer only through La Motte's reduction of the Iliad, which in turn was based upon Mme.
Dacier's translation.
If his object was to overthrow the great Greek poet, it must have been a bitter disappointment to Marivaux to see that his burlesque passed almost unnoticed by his contemporaries and was soon forgotten.
The same year he wrote a Telemaque travesti, a parody on the masterpiece of Fenelon.
This work was not published until mille sept cent trente-six, when it was received with such disapprobation that he hastened to disavow its authorship.
Marivaux was now some twenty-nine years of age, and had had but little success as a writer.
He must have felt that parody was not his forte, and, with his connection with le Mercure, an opportunity was presented to deal with actualities, where his powers of observation might come into play.
He was, as he says of himself, born an observer.
"C'est une fete delicieuse," he tells us, "pour un misanthrope, que le spectacle d'un si grand nombre d'hommes assembles; c'est le temps de sa recolte d'idees.
Cette innombrable quantite d'especes de mouvements forme a ses yeux un caractere generique.
----, containing reflections on the populace, the bourgeois, the merchants, the men and women of rank, and the beaux esprits." This seems to be a turning point in his literary life.
He appears now to have grasped the idea of his own limitations and of his own powers, powers which will be disclosed, not only in his journalistic work, but in his novels and his plays.
un refer to those excellences which are the direct result of the acuteness of his observation.
These writings gained for him the agnomen of Theophraste moderne, which his sense of fitness and natural dislike of over-praise led him to disclaim in a letter to the Mercure of October, mille sept cent dix-sept.
That same year a Portrait de Climene, ode anacreontique, proves that he had yet to sustain a real defeat in the line of verse before he came to realize that he should confine himself to prose alone.
The Mercure of March, mille sept cent dix-neuf, contained some Pensees sur divers sujets: sur la clarte du discours, sur la pensee sublime.
The next year, mille sept cent vingt, however, was one of the utmost importance in determining his future career.
When the crash came, in May, mille sept cent vingt, he lost all that he had.
In a letter, written in mille sept cent quarante, he relates the circumstances of the affair in so philosophical a tone that it is well worth reading.
moitie betise d'adolescence et adherence de petit garcon au conseil de ces gens senses, dont l'autorite etait regardee comme respectable, je les laissai disposer, vendre pour acheter, et ils me menaient comme ils voulaient...
However, all men fond of idleness are not necessarily idle, nor do all lazy men lack industry.
There are various motives that force them to labor, often mere pride, and more often still, necessity.
The loss of his fortune was a cruel blow, for it deprived him of the means of gratifying his fondness for dress and good living, and, worst of all, it debarred him largely from indulging his passion for charity.
His generosity and fellow-feeling for others were so great that he really suffered at sight of their misfortunes, if he was unable to alleviate them.
The following anecdote, related by both Lesbros de la Versane and d'Alembert, goes to show how far his love of giving sometimes led him.
One day he was accosted by a beggar, who seemed to him so young and strong that he was indignant, and, with a desire to shame him, asked him why he did not work.
"Helas! monsieur, si vous saviez combien je suis paresseux!" was the unexpected answer of the youth.
Marivaux, who hated all deceit, was so struck by the naive frankness of the reply that he gave him money to continue his idle way of life.
Another incident has come down to us from the same Sources.
A young actress, lacking in beauty and talent, had entered upon a career which Marivaux saw meant failure, and, to preserve her from the inevitable end, he persuaded her to enter a convent and provided the necessary funds, although at the price of great self-sacrifice.
Meanwhile Marivaux had married, at the age of thirty-three, a Mlle.
The Duke of Orleans, son of the Regent, through fondness for Marivaux, generously met all of the expenses of her installation.
Marivaux numbered among his faithful friends, La Motte, Fontenelle, Helvetius, Mme.
de Lambert, Mme.
de Tencin, Mme, de Bez, and, toward the end of his life, Mlle.
de Saint-Jean, and, had it not been for their generous aid, he would have almost lacked the necessities of life, not to mention the means for his charities.
Through the efforts of Mme.
de Tencin, he received an annuity of three thousand livres from Mme.
de Pompadour, who had the delicacy, however, to spare his pride by allowing him to attribute the gift to the generosity of Louis quinze.
The chagrin, caused by the discovery that the pension came, not from the king, but from the favourite, is said to have hastened his death, which followed a few months later.
Only three of his writings, and these among his early works, contain dedications--l'Homere travesti to the Duke de Noailles, la Double Inconstance to Madame de Prie, and the second Surprise de l'Amour to the Duchess du Maine.
There were at this time in Paris, besides the Opera, three theatres,  --the Theatre-Francais (known also as the Comedie-Francaise), the Theatre- Italien (or Comedie-Italienne), and the Theatre de la Foire, to name them in order of importance.
In mille sept cent vingt it occupied the Theatre de la Comedie-Francaise, on the rue des Fosses-Saint-Germain, since become the rue de l'Ancienne-Comedie.
Its reputation, as a criterion of dramatic art, was already established, and this reputation has ever since been sustained.
de Maintenon in la Fausse Prude, Paris had seen an almost uninterrupted succession of troupes of these Italian actors.
Up to this time almost unlimited license in language and themes had been tolerated in them.
Their exile lasted nineteen years, or until mille sept cent seize, when they were recalled by the Regent.
A new troupe was organized under the direction of Louis Riccoboni, a famous actor, and author, among other works, of a valuable history of the Theatre-Italien.
Riccoboni took the young lovers' parts and the name of Lelio.
The characters are those of the old commedia dell'arte.
However, written plays had now begun to take the place of the improvisation of the earlier Italian comedy.
In mille sept cent soixante-deux it lost its individuality, and became merged into the Opera-Comique, but that was some years after the last play of Marivaux had been staged, and does not concern us here.
For many years their performances consisted largely of juggling, tumbling, tight- rope walking, and the like, interspersed perhaps with dialogues, which, in time, came to occupy the principal part.
The characters were largely borrowed from the Italian commedia dell'arte.
Extreme license of expression characterized these plays.
Music often accompanied them.
In fact the Theatre de la Foire was the germ that later developed into the Opera-Comique.
However, in spite of difficulties and opposition the Theatre de la Foire maintained its ground.
Among the authors writing for the Theatre-Francais were such celebrities as Crebillon pere, Voltaire, Destouches, etc.
No lesser names than those of Lesage and Piron were the support of the Theatre de la Foire.
It remained for Marivaux to render illustrious the Italian stage.
Here it was, then, on the fourth of March, mille sept cent vingt, that he made his debut before the public with a comedy in three acts, l'Amour et la Verite.
It may be recalled that Crispin l'heureux fourbe had been presented only in private.
The developing influence of love is the theme of the comedy, and, although the development is rapid, as befits a play, it is nevertheless by graduated stages.
Each meeting of the lovers fans the flame, and the need of secrecy but stimulates their wit, until, at last, by a cunning wile, Harlequin gains possession of the fairy's wand and with it, of her power.
This, of course, brings about the natural denouement, and the play ends to the satisfaction of the lovers.
Many of the scenes are characterized by an artlessness and grace that recall Florian's les Deux Billets or Musset's A quoi revent les jeunes Filles.
It is the poetry of an epoch of prose.
His success was brilliant, and Arlequin poli par l'Amour had twelve representations.
At last Marivaux appears to have found his true sphere; but no, he has still to feel his way, and to experience another check, before entrusting himself to the promptings of his genius.
His was not a talent to blossom in a night, and only an over-zealous friend could say of him: "Il ne se decida point pour les lettres, il fut entraine par elles.
Il ne chercha point a devenir auteur, il fut etonne de l'etre devenu." At this time tragedy still held sway over the hearts of the French, although the period of its glory was past.
His Annibal, a tragedy in five acts and in verse, was produced at the Theatre-Francais on December seize, mille sept cent vingt.
In this play the very qualities, destined later to procure for the author such splendid successes in his comedies, were either lacking or out of place.
It survived four representations, three at the Theatre-Francais and one at Court, and then disappeared from the repertory, not to be taken up again until Marivaux was an academician, and as such, in the minds of many, of course worthy of applause.
His predilection for the Theatre-Italien was such that he gave to it twenty of his plays, while only ten were brought out at the Theatre-Francais.
Moreover, the Italians were performing in a foreign language and in a country in which they had a reputation yet to gain, and, consequently, were willing to accept suggestions from the author.
The prestige enjoyed by the members of the Comedie-Francaise was not calculated to make them readily accept advice, and Marivaux was often heard lamenting over their intractability.
The beauty of his plays depends upon the artless grace with which they are rendered.
"Il faut ...
Lecouvreur, of the Comedie-Francaise, who played the roles of the jeunes amoureuses, was the source of considerable annoyance to Marivaux.
She would often catch the spirit of these subtle and metaphysical roles in the first performances, but, encouraged by applause, and to improve, if possible, upon her manner, would so force the action as to become affected in the later representations.
At the Theatre-Italien, however, Marivaux found an actress just suited to these roles, Giovanna-Rosa Benozzi, the famous Silvia.
It was as a result of the presentation of the first Surprise de l'Amour that Marivaux made the acquaintance of the renowned actress.
With that characteristic timidity, which we have already noted, Marivaux had withheld from the public his name as author.
Although Silvia had played her part well, she felt that there was still lacking a shade of meaning, which, if she only knew the author, she might grasp.
Yielding to the solicitation of a friend of hers, Marivaux consented to pay her his respects, but on condition that he might keep his incognito.
Upon being presented to the artist, he congratulated her upon her charming rendition of the play.
Silvia was pleased with his appreciation, but, foreseeing possibilities in the piece as yet unattained by her, she said: "It is a charming comedy; but un have a grudge against the author...
for not disclosing himself.
Silvia the same year that the first Surprise de l'Amour appeared.
Marivaux joined also in the well-nigh universal chorus of praise which rose on all sides in celebration of the graceful actress.
If the author contributed much to the perfection of her talent, she, too, lent no small part to the    popularity which many of Marivaux's plays attained.
In the year of the presentation of the first Surprise de l'Amour, and the more speedily and surely to relieve his financial embarrassment, Marivaux turned his mind to journalism, and began the publication of what he termed le Spectateur francais, modelled after Addison's Spectator.
Strange to say, the Spectateur has never been as much appreciated in France as in England, where Marivaux has been compared not unfavorably with La Bruyere.
Germany was a scarcely less enthusiastic admirer, and even so severe a critic of French literature, as was Lessing, could find words of commendation for Marivaux; but the latter was less prodigal in his admiration of the works of foreign literatures.
"and preferred unhesitatingly our writers to those of any nation, ancient or modern," says d'Alembert.
The journal is composed of a series of feuilles or leaflets, more or less closely connected, familiar and conversational in character.
Most of the sketches are characterized by that intuitive and feminine delicacy of perception and that subtlety sometimes lacking in Addison, and, while perhaps too often they appear over quintessenced or subtilized, at times they attain an eloquent and virile tone.
Aside from their literary value, they are of great interest in the study of the author's character.
The concluding words of this sketch contain a confession of his own weakness, but with an eloquent and vigorous attack upon those who basely sacrifice the happiness of others for the gratification of their own pleasures.
"Homme riche, vous qui voulez triompher de sa vertu par sa misere, de grace, pretez-moi votre attention.
One is not accustomed to think of Marivaux as a moralist, yet this frilled and powdered representative of the beau monde, this courtly gentleman, this graceful writer, was one of the powers for good of his time.
Throughout his plays and novels, and particularly in his journals, may be seen this nobler side of the man's nature.
He was a practical moralist, with little love for abstract theories, and a morality far from asceticism, but, with profound unselfishness and pity for his fellow-man, he strove to right the wrongs and correct the abuses of a cruelly indifferent and light-hearted society.
He was likewise an opponent of the strained relations that existed in most families between parents and children.
Instead of the deplorable custom of making of each household a miniature court, in which the parents reigned over timid but unwilling subjects, he advocated intimate and loving relations.
"Voulez-vous faire d'honnetes gens de vos enfants? Ne soyez que leur pere, et non pas leur juge et leur tyran.
Et qu'est-ce que c'est qu'etre leur pere? c'est leur persuader que vous les aimez.
Cette persuasion-la commence par vous gagner leur coeur.
Nous aimons toujours ceux dont nous sommes surs d'etre aimes." Was it not Mme.
de Lambert, from whom Marivaux gained many of his ideas, who had said: "Les enfants aiment a etre traites en personnes raisonnables.
Marivaux has been said to have held revolutionary ideas, and, in some degree, to have forecast the terrible rending of society of mille sept cent quatre-vingt-neuf.
The increasing importance and the social elevation of servants in his drama is but another tendency along the same line.
One of the most obvious faults of the Spectateur francais was the irregular and disconnected manner of its publication.
This tendency may be seen in the Spectateur, which, after sundry interruptions, finally reaches the twenty-fifth leaflet, after which it suddenly, and without warning, comes to an end.
The same fate awaited the latter, and Marivaux's enthusiasm forsook him at the end of the eleventh leaflet, Fleury characterizes this as the best of his three periodical publications.
but un am of the opinion of Lavollee, who does not consider it comparable "either in interest or variety" with the Spectateur.
It is not alone in this style of literature that our author wearies of his theme and drops his pen, for neither of his novels Marianne nor le Paysan parvenu was completed.
It has long been thought that the twelfth part, which concludes the story of Marianne, was by Mme.
Riccoboni, and so cleverly, too, as to almost deceive the critics of the eighteenth century, did not appear until mille sept cent cinquante et un.
Marianne is a young girl, beautiful and of high birth, who, when but a small child, has the misfortune to lose her parents in an attack by robbers on the road to Bordeaux.
Sheltered by a priest and his sister, she reaches the age of fifteen, without, however, having discovered who her parents were.
Deprived by death of her guardians, she finds herself at this early age alone and unprotected in the streets of Paris.
She seeks the counsel of a kindly priest, who refers her to a rich and apparently respectable man, but in reality the personification of hypocrisy.
Of his character study of Monsieur de Climal, Marivaux was justly proud.
Few, if any, however, will justify him in rating it superior to Moliere's Tartuffe.
The story of Marianne is interesting, though never of so absorbing an interest as to hold the reader's attention more closely than was held that of the writer himself.
It is a book to be read by piecemeal, and it may be laid down at any time.
Indeed, one is not surprised, nor much distressed, when the author fails to grasp again his fallen pen after the eleventh part.
The thread of the story serves merely to join the analyses of character, moral reflections, and digressions of various kinds which abound.
The style is conversational, very similar to that of his journals.
Taken as a whole it may be considered as a psychological study of a young girl's heart, as viewed by herself in maturer years.
un am half inclined to say the heart of a coquette, for Marianne has much of the coquette in her nature, but she has, too, the nobler qualities of heart and mind.
She is an epitome, in short, of the feminine side of Marivaux.
One of the chief faults of the author's style is apparent in Marianne to a degree unparalleled by most of his other writings, and that is the fault of over-elaborate description or definition.
His subtle mind could perceive so many delicate shades of character, which the less cultivated eye could not detect, that, by elaborating thereupon and endeavoring to disclose to others what he saw, he seemed to overdefine, or even to repeat himself, and sometimes became monotonous.
His was the delicate ear of the musical prodigy, capable of grasping half-tones quite beyond the range of the normal ear, and his attempt to cause them to be heard and appreciated by his coarser fellows brought him only criticism and abuse.
N'etes-vous pas de meme? Il me semble que mon ame, en mille occasions, en sait plus qu'elle n'en peut dire, et qu'elle a un esprit a part, qui est bien superieur a celui que j'ai d'ordinaire.
His struggle with himself and his apology to the reader are sometimes quite amusing in their naivete.
"Me voila au bout de ma reflexion," he says: "j'aurais pourtant grande envie d'y ajouter quelques mots pour la rendre complete: le voulez-vous bien? Oui, je vous en prie.
Heureusement que mon defaut la-dessus n'a rien de nouveau pour vous.
Je suis insupportable avec mes reflexions, vous le savez bien." The success that greeted Marianne was calculated to make his rivals in the field of fiction jealous.
Perhaps no one felt more keenly than did Crebillon fils the growing popularity of a novel the purity of which but enhanced the obscenity of his own writings.
To this feeling may be attributed his attack upon Marivaux's style in a very free and tiresome story, entitled Tanzai et Neadarne, ou l'Ecumoire, in which his rival's muse is represented as a mole.
The mole relates her life, in a most diffuse and wearisome manner, constantly interrupting the story with reflections and digressions.
The imitation was so clever that it deceived even Marivaux himself into thinking that a justification of his style was intended.
Doubtless the offense that he felt was the greater, owing to this additional wound to his amour-propre.
At any rate, for the first time he dignified a criticism by a reply in print.
Even here he did not go so far as to mention any name, but the allusion to Crebillon fils was evident.
"Il est vrai, monsieur, que nous sommes naturellement libertins, ou, pour mieux dire, corrompus; mais en fait d'ouvrages d'esprit, il ne faut pas prendre cela a la lettre ni nous traiter d'emblee sur ce pied-la.
Un lecteur veut etre menage.
Vous, auteur, voulez-vous mettre sa corruption dans vos interets? Allez-y doucement du moins, apprivoisez-la, mais ne la poussez pas a bout.
Attention has already been called to the leniency of Marivaux with regard to weaknesses of a certain type, and to his confession of his own shortcomings.
Mention has been made of the feminine side of Marivaux's writings, but the Paysan parvenu, published in mille sept cent trente-cinq, some six years before the last publication of Marianne is of an entirely different type.
Habert, whom his youth and charms entice.
Quite another Bel Ami, as Jules Lemaitre remarks; but the dissimilarity is no less striking than the resemblance.
The hero of Maupassant, on the other hand, is basely sensual and cruelly self-interested from the first, and totally lacking in those heart-qualities which, in spite of his vices, gain our sympathies for Jacob.
The style of the Paysan parvenu is simpler, less diffuse, bolder, and more virile, than that of Marianne; but its characters are uniformly less noble, and, if its general intent is not immoral, at least many of the scenes verge upon the risque.
The scene of Marianne is laid in aristocratic circles, while that of the Paysan presents to us the bourgeoisie and the world of finance.
Though there are many differences between these two novels, there are likewise many points of similarity.
We have to do with the same cunning observer, and with one who did not consider the common people beneath his notice.
Marivaux has in his style of description many traits of the realist, as we understand the term to-day.
Habert ainee; but, while false devotion was constantly the object of his most bitter hatred, his attitude toward true religion was noteworthy, especially for the time in which he lived.
"A Dieu ne plaise qu'on me soupconne d'avoir, un seul instant de ma vie, doute de ce que nous dit cette religion," he exclaims through the lips of one of his characters.
Opinions differ greatly as to the comparative merits of Marivaux the novelist and Marivaux the dramatist.
His contemporaries considered him superior in the former capacity.
Larroumet classes him in the "small number of those who have shown themselves equally fitted for the drama and the novel," while Sainte-Beuve  declares for the superiority of his drama.
Certainly, one does not weary of his delightful comedies, never long enough to tire, even were they less fascinating than they are, for they never exceed three acts, except in the case of the Serments indiscrets, which is in five.
His creative genius is seen, as nowhere else, in these brief comedies.
After the haute comedie of Moliere, with its presentation of types of character rather than of individuals, and with its general lessons to mankind, it would have been impossible for Marivaux to have gained glory in the same field.
His fondness for originality forbade him from following the traces of his predecessors.
In what does the originality of the comedies of Marivaux consist? In general, one may say, in his treatment of love, their prevailing theme.
"Chez mes confreres," says Marivaux, "l'amour est en querelle avec ce qui l'environne, et finit par etre heureux, malgre les opposants; chez moi, il n'est en querelle qu'avec lui seul, et finit par etre heureux malgre lui.
Il apprendra dans mes pieces a se defier encore plus des tours qu'il se joue, que des pieges qui lui sont tendus par des mains etrangeres." It is true that throughout his plays the lovers rarely encounter any hindrance from without.
There is very little action or intrigue.
The dialogue, witty, brilliant, and ingenious, is all-important, and the denouement often depends upon a misunderstanding, so easy to explain that one sometimes wonders at the wilfulness of the characters in failing to set the matter right until the end.
Some have gone so far as to say that it is not amour at all that he portrays, but only amour-propre.
It is a gentle, courtly love, respectful, almost reverential, though not confiding.
"Marivaux pense et dit de l'amour ce qu'en pensait, ce qu'en disait l'auteur de la premiere partie de ce Roman de la Rose, Ou l'art d'Amour est toute enclose.
Par sa fine sentimentalite, par sa casuistique amoureuse, par son gout pour l'allegorie, Marivaux aurait fraternise, au XIIIe siecle, avec le suave Guillaume de Lorris." His drama is eminently psychological.
The comedies of Marivaux rarely provoke more than a smile, and never bursts of merriment.
The pathetic is no less lacking, and yet the interest never flags.
Where, then, is their charm? It lies in the brilliant dialogue and in the interest Marivaux has been able to awaken in the psychological development of love in the hearts of the chief characters.
Ou est en cela toute cette ressemblance qu'on ne cesse de m'objecter?" The years have passed, and critics have fully justified this plea.
The most convincing argument is undoubtedly the examination of the plays themselves.
Leaving out of account le Pere prudent and Annibal, the following more or less arbitrary classification may serve to show the predominating note in each comedy:-- I.
Comedies de caractere.--La Fausse Suivante (mille sept cent vingt-quatre), le Petit-maitre corrige(mille sept cent trente-quatre), la Mere confidente (mille sept cent trente-cinq), les Sinceres (mille sept cent trente-neuf), l'Epreuve (mille sept cent quarante).
Comedies de moeurs.--L'Heritier de Village (mille sept cent vingt-cinq), l'Ecole des Meres (mille sept cent trente-deux), le Prejuge vaincu (mille sept cent quarante-six).
Comedies heroiques.--Le Prince travesti (mille sept cent vingt-quatre), le Triomphe de l'Amour (mille sept cent trente-deux), la Dispute (mille sept cent quarante-quatre).
Comedies philosophiques.--L'Ile des Esclaves (mille sept cent vingt-cinq), l'Ile de la Raison (mille sept cent vingt-sept), la Colonie (mille sept cent vingt-neuf).
Comedies mythologiques.--Le Triomphe de Plutus (mille sept cent vingt-huit), la Reunion des Amours (mille sept cent trente et un).
Comedies feeries.--Arlequin poli par l'Amour (mille sept cent vingt), Felicie (mille sept cent cinquante-sept).
Fantaisie.--Les Acteurs de bonne foi (mille sept cent cinquante-sept).
trois cent treize-trois cent dix-neuf] and by Fleury [pp.
trois cent soixante-cinq-trois cent soixante et onze]).
From this classification it will be seen that by no means all of Marivaux's comedies could be termed Surprises de l'amour, although some of his best come within that category.
There is a whole series of plays, to which Larroumet calls attention, in which Marivaux has left the real for the imaginary world.
In the limited space of this Introduction it will be impossible to analyze the plots of any, save only the most important.
The following comedies are about the only ones presented regularly at the Comedie- Francaise: le Jeu de l'Amour et du Hasard, le Legs, les Fausses Confidences, and l'Epreuve; but this brief list by no means embraces all of his exquisite sketches of eighteenth century society.
As we have already examined one of the most delightful pieces of the latter class, Arlequin poli par l'Amour, a hasty survey of his best known plays will have to suffice.
It might be well to add here that Marivaux's favourite plays were the following: la Double Inconstance, the two Surprises de l'Amour, la Mere confidente, les Serments indiscrets, les Sinceres and l'Ile des Esclaves.
Le Jeu de l'Amour et du Hasard, a comedy in three acts, presented on January vingt-trois, mille sept cent trente, at the Theatre-Italien, is generally considered as the masterpiece of Marivaux, although he did not include it in the number of his favourites.
It is certainly his best-known play.
Its success was great and immediate, according to the Mercure of January, mille sept cent trente.
The prejudice of birth, against which Marivaux contended so often, is overthrown, and the lovers are willing, if necessary, to yield all for love.
Silvia is still struggling with her sense of duty, when she discovers Dorante's identity, but is unwilling to disclose herself and say the final word, until she is convinced that Dorante loves her for herself alone.
The scenes between Harlequin and Lisette, their language, now exaggerated, now trivial, and their haste to fall in love, lend the comic to the play.
Le Legs, a comedy in one act, was produced at the Theatre-Francais, January onze, mille sept cent trente-six.
Its reception was rather cold the first night, but enthusiastic on subsequent performances.
Lenient says of it: "Le Legs est entre toutes ses oeuvres le specimen de la bluette reduite a sa plus simple expression, joignant la finesse et la tenuite de la trame a l'exiguite de la donnee.
Tout cela tiendrait dans une coquille de noix, et finit par remplir un acte.
Hortense, likewise in love with another, the Chevalier, whose fortune is not large, seeks naturally to come into her inheritance without sacrificing herself to an odious marriage.
In order to deceive the other into renouncing his share of the property, each feigns willingness to enter into the marriage as stipulated in the will.
The servants, as is usually the case in Marivaux's comedies, play an important role, and seek to further their own selfish interests.
The play ends with the renunciation of the two hundred thousand francs on the part of the Marquis, who has at last become bold enough to declare himself, after manifold hints on the part of the Comtesse; and love triumphs.
Thus with apparently little to work upon has been wrought out an entire comedy, interesting from beginning to end.
Alfred de Musset has made over this comedy in his l'Ane et le Ruisseau, but has come far short of the original.
Les Fausses Confidences, a comedy in three acts, was brought out at the Comedie-Italienne, March seize, mille sept cent trente-sept.
This piece has sometimes vied with le Jeu de l'Amour et du Hasard for the title of Marivaux's chef-d'oeuvre.
Without doubt, it is one of the most charming of the author's works.
Je meriterais bien d'appeler cette femme-la ma bru." The plot is complicated by the role of Mlle.
Marton, companion to Araminte, who is led by Monsieur Remy, Dorante's uncle, to consider herself the object of the young man's affection, and thus to second his ambition.
Marivaux, made use of the same theme in a later comedy, le Prejuge vaincu, but the prejudice attacked was that of birth, instead of wealth, as here, where both parties belong to the world of the bourgeoisie.
L'Epreuve has been called le chant du cygne of Marivaux.
It was the last play he gave to the Theatre-Italien, and was performed November dix-neuf, mille sept cent quarante.
It is a little comedy in one act, and belongs to the small number of those that were enthusiastically received on their "first night." Marivaux admits this characteristic of his plays in the Avertissement to les Serments indiscrets.
He informs her that he has in mind for her a wealthy party and an intimate friend of his.
In her artlessness Angelique concludes from his description that he means himself.
In her joy she confides the matter to Lisette.
He bien! Mademoiselle, etes-vous instruite? A qui vous marie-t-on? A lui, ma chere Lisette, a lui-meme, et je l'attends.
A lui, dites-vous? Et quel est donc cet homme qui s'appelle lui par excellence? Est-ce qu'il est ici? A charming bit of dialogue, and but another proof of Marivaux's insight into a young girl's heart.
This character is the amusing factor of the play, Lucidor urges him to win her hand, but offers, as a compensation, if he loses, twelve thousand livres.
This, of course, is sufficient to turn the tide and to enlist the interest of Blaise to fail, if possible, in his forced suit of Angelique.
The trial proves Angelique superior to money considerations, and love triumphs.
This too was one of the plays, the reception of which was favorable.
The lesson that it intended to teach, for it has a lesson, was one that we have already seen emphasized, by Marivaux, the rights of children, the duty of parents to respect them, and the advisability of gaining their love and confidence.
In Madame Argante of la Mere confidente we have the counterpart of the arrogant mother of the same name of les Fausses Confidences, indifferent to her daughter's real welfare, but powerless to control her will.
Madame Argante of la Mere confidente believes in gentle government by love.
Her daughter Angelique is a charming girl, anxious to do the right, but deeply in love with, a young man, Dorante, unknown to her mother, and without fortune.
Madame Argante has already made her choice of an older man, Ergaste, for whose wealth and respectability she has a natural admiration, but, with her characteristic kindliness, determines not to force her choice upon her daughter.
"Vous ne l'epouserez pas malgre vous, ma chere enfant," she says, meeting the objection of Angelique, and then, seeing that there is some secret trouble, she seeks in the most graceful, tactful way to learn the truth.
...
Parle-moi a coeur ouvert; fais-moi ta confidente.
Vous, la confidente de votre fille? Oh! votre fille, et qui te parle d'elle? Ce n'est point ta mere qui veut etre ta confidente; c'est ton amie, encore une fois.
ANGELIQUE, riant.
D'accord; mais mon amie redira tout a ma mere; l'une est inseparable de l'autre.
Eh bien! je les separe, moi; je t'en fais serment.
Oui, mets-toi dans l'esprit que ce que tu me confieras sur ce pied-la, c'est comme si ta mere ne l'entendait pas....
Little by little the mother gains the daughter's confidence, until at last, emboldened, Angelique confesses: Vous m'avez demande si on avait attaque mon coeur? Que trop, puisque j'aime! MADAME ARGANTE, d'un air serieux.
Vous aimez?...
ANGELIQUE, riant.
Eh bien! ne voila-t-il pas cette mere qui est absente? C'est pourtant elle qui me repond; mais rassurez-vous, car je badine.
Nothing could be more graceful or more natural.
This she attempts to do, but love will have its way, and will not be put down.
An elopement is arranged, which is interrupted by the arrival of Madame Argante, who takes Dorante to task for his indifference to the real happiness of Angelique.
He is covered with confusion, confesses his mistake, and by his manly attitude gains the mother's heart and the daughter's hand.
Ergaste, the rejected suitor, proves to be an uncle of Dorante, and in a spirit of self-abnegation, well nigh superhuman, devotes himself to celibacy and his fortune to the lovers.
Lisette plays the role of the intrigante and temptress of her mistress.
The comic of the piece is in the hands of Lubin, a peasant in the service of the family, who is bribed by each party to spy upon the other.
Lack of space forbids more than a mere mention of the remaining plays, many of which are worthy of being compared favourably with those which have been outlined.
We have seen enough to convince us that, although his drama may be classified in general as psychological and feminin there is great diversity in the individual plays, and never monotony.
The roles of women are the important ones in the works of this author.
In this particular the comedies of Marivaux recall the tragedies of Racine.
Brunetiere goes so far as to claim that "the roles of women in Marivaux's drama are almost the only women's roles" in the whole repertory of French comedies.
Of Moliere's drama he recognizes only three such roles as clearly individualized, those of Agnes, Elmire and Celimene.
His soubrettes resemble closely their mistresses, to such a degree that by exchanging roles they may readily be mistaken for them, as we have seen in le Jeu de l'Amour et du Hasard.
Unlike those of Moliere, they are always refined and graceful, and are none the less witty.
Contrary to their more cautious mistresses, they all, or nearly all, believe in love, and seek to further the marriage of the former.
Lisette of le Legs is an exception.
In short, all of the younger women of Marivaux are the perfection of grace, beauty, delicacy, wit or artlessness, and are simply irresistible.
It is only the mothers that merit our aversion.
With few exceptions, notably Mme.
Argante in la Mere confidente, he paints them "laides, vaines, imperieuses, avares, entichees de prejuges." "Il ne pare pas du moindre rayon de coquetterie leurs maussades et acariatres personnes.
Il a de la peine a ne pas ceder, quand il s'agit d'elles, a la tentation de la caricature.
On dirait qu'il se venge." The roles of fathers, on the other hand, are treated with great affection.
They are always kind and indulgent, and exercise their authority as little as possible.
His valets, like his soubrettes, are more refined than those of Moliere, that is to say, are higher in the social scale, and are treated by their masters with more consideration.
The changes, soon to be wrought in the old regime, are already germinating.
While almost rivalling their masters in wit, they yet occupy a secondary place upon the stage, and rarely dwarf by their own cleverness, as do often those of Moliere, their master's roles.
"Three of these valets are real creations.
Dubois of les Fausses Confidences, Trivelin, of la Fausse Suivante, Lepine of le Legs." Trivelin is the ancestor of Beaumarchais' Figaro.
Marivaux has introduced into a number of his plays peasants of the cunning, calculating, Norman type, who speak a Norman patois, which may be a souvenir of his own Norman origin.
Piron, who could not resist an occasional thrust at his rivals, was guilty of the following witticism: "Fontenelle a engendre Marivaux, Marivaux a engendre Moncrif, et Moncrif n'engendrera personne." The boutade is amusing, but not just.
Moncrif can hardly be considered an offspring of Marivaux, although he imitated certain of his coquettish graces, any more, or perhaps even much less, than the latter, may be considered an offspring of Fontenelle.
One feature common to all of the writings of our author, as to many of his contemporaries, is their lack of the sentiment of nature.
There are no streams, no flowers, no birds throughout his works.
The two slight exceptions, mentioned by Larroumet, show so evident a lack of interest in the beauties of nature that they offer the strongest proof in support of the rule.
Here they are, the first from the eighth and the second from the eleventh part of Marianne: "Pendant qu'on etait la- dessus, je feignis quelque curiosite de voir un cabinet de verdure qui etait au bout de la terrasse.
Il me parait fort joli, dis-je a Valville, pour l'engager a m'y mener."  --"Il faisait un fort beau jour, et il y avait dans l'hotellerie un jardin qui me parut assez joli.
Je fus curieuse de le voir, et j'y entrai.
Nous avons les plus belles allees du monde!" There is one passage, however, in the fifth part, in which Marivaux gives evidence of a frank and simple enjoyment of nature: "Nous nous promenions tous trois dans le bois de la maison;...
His ideas on style may be found in the sixth leaflet of the Cabinet du Philosophe, in which he answers the accusations of his critics.
With him the idea is primary and the word used to express it but secondary.
Wherefore, an author should be judged rather by the thoughts which the words express than by the words themselves.
"Venons maintenant a l'application de tout ce que j'ai dit.
Vous accusez un auteur d'avoir un style precieux.
Qu'est-ce que cela signifie?...
If, then, his thoughts are understood, the next question is whether they could be formed with fewer ideas, and consequently fewer words, and still convey to the hearer all the necessary finesse, all of the delicate shades of meaning.
"Il y a des gens qui, en faisant un ouvrage d'esprit, ne saisissent pas toujours precisement une certaine idee qu'ils voudraient joindre a une autre.
Ils la cherchent; ils l'ont dans l'instinct, dans le fond de l'ame; mais ils ne sauraient la developper.
Par paresse, ou par necessite, ou par lassitude.
In the seventh leaflet of the Spectateur he replies to the accusation that he attempted in his writings to display his wit at the expense of naturalness.
That is to say, he was less inclined to coin new words, or even to use old words with new meanings, than he was to employ unusual and peculiar turns of expression.
Some of the expressions which were considered reprehensible by Desfontaines have since been received into common parlance, and so do not appear unnatural or unusual: sortir de sa coquille, etc.
La vie que je mene aujourd'hui n'est point batarde, elle vient bien en A phrase ending in a surprise: Je gage que tu m'aimes.--Je ne parie jamais, je perds toujours.
Such expressions, or, at least, those in which the exaggeration of the figure is most apparent, are usually found in the mouths of servants and peasants, to which class such complicated language is not unnatural.
A very minor phase of the literary activity of Marivaux remains to be considered, and that is his work in criticism.
Eulogiums of the tragedies of Crebillon pere, of the Romulus and the Ines de Castro of La Motte, and of the Lettres persanes of Montesquieu constitute almost his entire equipment in this line.
In it he has shown himself a fair and competent judge of this first celebrated work of Montesquieu.
If Marivaux, yielding to his sense of etiquette and good breeding, was sparing in his criticism of his contemporaries, he was certainly not spared by them.
The circle of his friends was small, but intimate, and his timidity with men, his suspiciousness, his lack of self-assertion, made him an easy prey to such unscrupulous opponents as Voltaire.
Marivaux was ever ready to accept a criticism that seemed to him deserved.
"J'ai eu tort de donner cette comedie-ci au theatre," he says in the preface to his Ile de la Raison: "Elle n'etait pas bonne a etre representee, et le public lui a fait justice en la condamnant.
However, notwithstanding his readiness to acknowledge his own defects, and to defer to the opinions of others, Marivaux required the criticism to be fair- minded and impersonal.
Ah! que nous irions loin, qu'il naitrait de beaux ouvrages, si la plupart des gens d'esprit qui en sont les juges, tatonnaient un peu avant de dire, cela est mauvais ou cela est bon! ...
mais je voudrais des critiques qui pussent corriger et non pas gater, qui reformassent ce qu'il y aurait de defectueux dans le caractere d'esprit d'un auteur, et qui ne lui fissent pas quitter ce caractere.
"C'est un homme," says Voltaire, "qui passe sa vie a peser des riens dans des balances de toile d'araignee" ...
Monsieur de Voltaire est la perfection des idees communes....
As much cannot be said of the latter, who, in letters written at this time, shows a cowardly fear of Marivaux's acceptance of the offer.
Voltaire was not the only rival to show hostility.
Destouches, in the Envieux, ou la Critique du Philosophe marie (douze), Le Sage, in Gil Blas (Book sept, chapter treize), as well as Crebillon fils, in the work already mentioned, were among the number.
de Tencin had set her mind upon making of him an academician, and spared no pains to accomplish her purpose.
Voltaire, although a dangerous competitor, was not received until three years later; Piron, Le Sage, and Crebillon fils, never.
Strangely enough, this painter of gay and brilliant society succeeded to the fauteuil of an ecclesiastic, l'abbe d'Houtteville, and was welcomed by another, Languet de Gergy, archbishop of Sens.
At his death his place was filled by still another, a certain abbe de Radonvilliers.
The task of the archbishop was not one of the easiest, for it devolved upon him to eulogize an author, many of whose works, by reason of his ecclesiastical position, he was not supposed to have read.
Le celebre La Bruyere parait, dit-on, ressusciter en vous..." are criticisms upon the immoral influence of certain of his works, particularly the Paysan parvenu, which claim to have a moral aim.
Nothing, perhaps, could have so wounded Marivaux as this imputation, for few writers have been actuated by purer and more noble motives, and it was with difficulty that he restrained his impulse to call upon the assembled company for justification.
A Lettre a une dame sur la perte d'un perroquet, in verse, may serve to represent the decline of his genius.
His popularity waned and was eclipsed by that of the vigorous writers and philosophical thinkers that followed him.
His graceful sketches were soon to be forgotten in those terrible scenes that closed the century, which the most morbid and foreboding mind could scarcely have foreseen or pictured in the lurid colourings that history has painted them.
His closing years were embittered by a knowledge of his failing powers and a growing suspiciousness of those about him, and his increasing poverty would have made his sufferings more keen, had it not been for the generous devotion of a friend, Mlle.
de Saint-Jean, with whom he lived for the last few years of his life, in her apartments, rue de Richelieu, and whose modest fortune he shared.
He died on February douze, "after a rather long illness," which he bore with fortitude, and "with all the tranquillity of a Christian philosopher" saw the inevitable end approach.
His death passed almost unnoticed by his contemporaries.

This essay by De la Porte is quite fair and trustworthy.
It is particularly interesting as being the first.
It is followed by an Eloge, or, rather, a contemptuous sketch, for it is anything but a eulogy, published by Palissot (and de Sivry) in the Necrologe des hommes celebres of mille sept cent soixante-quatre.
These are the sources from which d'Alembert drew most of the matter for his Eloge, which is characterized by a kindly criticism, that, though sometimes too severe, does not offend.

Amsterdam, mille sept cent trente-neuf.
Representee pour la premiere fois par les Comediens Italiens ordinaires du Roi, le vingt-trois janvier mille sept cent trente.
LISETTE, femme de chambre de Silvia.
ARLEQUIN, valet de Dorante.
La scene est a Paris.
Mais, encore une fois, de quoi vous melez-vous? Pourquoi repondre de mes sentiments? C'est que j'ai cru que, dans cette occasion-ci, vos sentiments ressembleroient a ceux de tout le monde.
Monsieur votre pere me demande si vous etes bien aise qu'il vous marie, si vous en avez quelque joie.
Moi, je lui reponds qu'oui; cela va tout de suite; et il n'y a peut-etre que vous de fille au monde pour qui ce oui-la ne soit pas vrai.
Le non n'est pas naturel.
Le non n'est pas naturel? Quelle sotte naivete! Le mariage auroit donc de grands charmes pour vous? Eh bien! c'est encore oui, par exemple.
Taisez-vous; allez repondre vos impertinences ailleurs, et sachez que ce n'est pas a vous a juger de mon coeur par le votre.
Mon coeur est fait comme celui de tout le monde.
De quoi le votre s'avise- t-il de n'etre fait comme celui de personne? Je vous dis que, si elle osoit, elle m'appellerait une originale.
Si j'etois votre egale, nous verrions.
Vous travaillez a me facher.
Ce n'est pas mon dessein.
Mais, dans le fond, voyons, quel mal ai-je fait de dire a monsieur Orgon que vous etiez bien aise d'etre mariee? Premierement, c'est que tu n'as pas dit vrai: je ne m'ennuie pas d'etre fille.
Cela est encore tout neuf.
C'est qu'il n'est pas necessaire que mon pere croie me faire tant de plaisir en me mariant, parce que cela le fait agir avec une confiance qui ne servira peut-etre de rien.
Quoi! vous n'epouserez pas celui qu'il vous destine? Que sais-je? Peut-etre ne me conviendra-t-il point, et cela m'inquiete.
On dit que votre futur est un des plus honnetes hommes du monde; qu'il est bien fait, aimable, de bonne mine; qu'on ne peut pas avoir plus d'esprit; qu'on ne sauroit etre d'un meilleur caractere.
Aimable, bien fait, voila de quoi vivre pour l'amour; sociable et spirituel, voila pour l'entretien de la societe.
Pardi! tout en sera bon dans cet homme-la; l'utile et l'agreable, tout s'y trouve.
Oui, dans le portrait que tu en fais, et on dit qu'il y ressemble; mais c'est un on dit, et je pourrais bien n'etre pas de ce sentiment-la, moi.
Il est bel homme, dit-on, et c'est presque tant pis.
Tant pis! tant pis! mais voila une pensee bien heteroclite! C'est une pensee de tres bon sens.
Volontiers un bel homme est fat; je l'ai remarque.
Oh! il a tort d'etre fat, mais il a raison d'etre beau.
On ajoute qu'il est bien fait; passe.
Oui-da, cela est pardonnable.
De beaute et de bonne mine, je l'en dispense; ce sont la des agrements superflus.
Vertuchoux! si je me marie jamais, ce superflu-la sera mon necessaire.
Tu ne sais ce que tu dis.
Dans le mariage, on a plus souvent affaire a l'homme raisonnable qu'a l'aimable homme: en un mot, je ne lui demande qu'un bon caractere, et cela est plus difficile a trouver qu'on ne pense.
Monsieur un tel a l'air d'un galant homme, d'un homme bien raisonnable, disoit-on tous les jours d'Ergaste.
Aussi l'est-il repondoit-on; je l'ai repondu moi-meme.
Sa physionomie ne vous ment pas d'un mot.
Oui, fiez-vous y a cette physionomie si douce, si prevenante, qui disparoit un quart d'heure apres, pour faire place a un visage sombre, brutal, farouche, qui devient l'effroi de toute une maison.
Ergaste s'est marie; sa femme, ses enfants, son domestique, ne lui connoissent encore que ce visage-la, pendant qu'il promene partout ailleurs cette physionomie si aimable que nous lui voyons, et qui n'est qu'un masque qu'il prend au sortir de chez lui.
Quel fantasque avec ses deux visages! N'est-on pas content de Leandre, quand on le voit? Eh bien! chez lui, c'est un homme qui ne dit mot, qui ne rit ni qui ne gronde: c'est une ame glacee, solitaire, inaccessible.
Sa femme ne la connoit point, n'a point de commerce avec elle; elle n'est mariee qu'avec une figure qui sort d'un cabinet, qui vient a table, et qui fait expirer de langueur, de froid et d'ennui tout ce qui l'environne.
N'est-ce pas la un mari bien amusant? Je gele au recit que vous m'en faites.
Mais Tersandre, par exemple? Oui, Tersandre! il venoit l'autre jour de s'emporter contre sa femme.
J'arrive, on m'annonce: je vois un homme qui vient a moi les bras ouverts, d'un air serein, degage; vous auriez dit qu'il sortait de la conversation la plus badine; sa bouche et ses yeux rioient encore.
Le fourbe! Voila ce que c'est que les hommes.
Elle me fit pitie, Lisette; si j'allois te faire pitie aussi? Cela est terrible! qu'en dis-tu? Songe a ce que c'est qu'un mari.
Un mari? c'est un mari.
Vous ne deviez pas finir par ce mot-la; il me raccommode avec tout le reste.
Eh! bonjour, ma fille.
La nouvelle que je viens t'annoncer te fera-t-elle plaisir? Ton pretendu arrive aujourd'hui; son pere me l'apprend par cette lettre-ci.
Tu ne me reponds rien; tu me parois triste.
Lisette de son cote baisse les yeux.
Que veut dire ce galimatias? Une ame, un portrait! Explique-toi donc: je n'y entends rien.
C'est que j'entretenois Lisette du malheur d'une femme maltraitee par son mari; je lui citois celle de Tersandre, que je trouvai l'autre jour fort abattue, parce que son mari venoit de la quereller; et je faisois la- dessus mes reflexions.
Oui, nous parlions d'une physionomie qui va et qui vient; nous disions qu'un mari porte un masque avec le monde, et une grimace avec sa femme.
De tout cela, ma fille, je comprends que le mariage t'alarme, d'autant plus que tu ne connois point Dorante.
Premierement, il est beau; et c'est presque tant pis.
Tant pis! Reves-tu, avec ton tant pis? Moi, je dis ce qu'on m'apprend: c'est la doctrine de Madame; j'etudie sous elle.
Allons, allons, il n'est pas question de tout cela.
Tiens, ma chere enfant, tu sais combien je t'aime.
Dorante vient pour t'epouser.
Dans le dernier voyage que je fis en province, j'arretai ce mariage-la avec son pere, qui est mon intime et mon ancien ami; mais ce fut a condition que vous vous plairiez a tous deux et que vous auriez entiere liberte de vous expliquer la-dessus.
Je te defends toute complaisance a mon egard.
Je suis penetree de vos bontes, mon pere.
Vous me defendez toute complaisance, et je vous obeirai.
Je te l'ordonne.
Mais, si j'osois, je vous proposerois, sur une idee qui me vient, de m'accorder une grace qui me tranquilliseroit tout a fait.
Parle ...
Si la chose est faisable, je te l'accorde.
Elle est tres faisable; mais je crains que ce ne soit abuser de vos bontes.
Eh bien! abuse.
Va, dans ce monde, il faut etre un peu trop bon pour l'etre assez.
Il n'y a que le meilleur de tous les hommes qui puisse dire cela.
Explique-toi, ma fille.
Dorante arrive ici aujourd'hui....
Si je pouvois le voir, l'examiner un peu sans qu'il me connut! Lisette a de l'esprit, Monsieur; elle pourroit prendre ma place pour un peu de temps, et je prendrois la sienne.
Monsieur ORGON, a part.
Son idee est plaisante.
(Haut.) Laisse-moi rever un peu a ce que tu me dis la.
(A part.) Si je la laisse faire, il doit arriver quelque chose de bien singulier.
Elle ne s'y attend pas elle-meme....
(Haut.) Soit, ma fille, je te permets le deguisement.
Es-tu bien sure de soutenir le tien, Lisette? Moi, Monsieur? Vous savez qui je suis; essayez de m'en conter, et manquez de respect, si vous l'osez, a cette contenance-ci.
Voila un echantillon des bons airs avec lesquels je vous attends.
Qu'en dites- vous? Hem? retrouvez-vous Lisette? Comment donc! je m'y trompe actuellement moi-meme.
Mais il n'y a point de temps a perdre: va t'ajuster suivant ton role.
Dorante peut nous surprendre.
Hatez-vous, et qu'on donne le mot a toute la maison.
Il ne me faut presque qu'un tablier.
Et moi, je vais a ma toilette.
Venez m'y coiffer, Lisette, pour vous accoutumer a vos fonctions....
Un peu d'attention a votre service, s'il vous plait.
Vous serez contente, marquise.
Marchons! Ma soeur, je te felicite de la nouvelle que j'apprends....
Nous allons voir ton amant, dit-on.
Oui, mon frere, mais je n'ai pas le temps de m'arreter: j'ai des affaires serieuses, et mon pere vous les dira.
Je vous quitte.
Ne l'amusez pas, Mario; venez, vous saurez de quoi il s'agit.
Qu'y a-t-il de nouveau, Monsieur? Je commence par vous recommander d'etre discret sur ce que je vais vous dire, au moins.
Je suivrai vos ordres.
Nous verrons Dorante aujourd'hui; mais nous ne le verrons que deguise.
Deguise! Viendra-t-il en partie de masque? lui donnerez-vous le bal? Ecoutez l'article de la lettre du pere.
Hum!...
Ah! ah! cela sera plaisant.
Pour moi, qui m'en fie bien a ce que vous m'avez dit de votre aimable fille, j'ai consenti a tout, en prenant la precaution de vous avertir, quoiqu'il m'ait demande le secret de votre cote.
Vous en userez la-dessus avec la future comme vous le jugerez a propos....
Voila ce que le pere m'ecrit.
Ce n'est pas le tout; voici ce qui arrive: c'est que votre soeur, inquiete de son cote sur le chapitre de Dorante, dont elle ignore le secret, m'a demande de jouer ici la meme comedie, et cela, precisement pour observer Dorante, comme Dorante veut l'observer.
Qu'en dites-vous? Savez-vous rien de plus particulier que cela? Actuellement la maitresse et la suivante se travestissent.
Que me conseillez-vous, Mario? Avertirai-je votre soeur, ou non? Ma foi, Monsieur, puisque les choses prennent ce train-la, je ne voudrois pas les deranger, et je respecterois l'idee qui leur est inspiree a l'un et a l'autre.
Il faudra bien qu'ils se parlent souvent tous deux sous ce deguisement.
Voyons si leur coeur ne les avertiroit pas de ce qu'ils valent.
Peut-etre que Dorante prendra du gout pour ma soeur, toute soubrette qu'elle sera, et cela seroit charmant pour elle.
Nous verrons un peu comment elle se tirera d'intrigue.
C'est une aventure qui ne sauroit manquer de nous divertir.
Je veux me trouver au debut et les agacer tous deux.
Me voila, Monsieur: ai-je mauvaise grace en femme de chambre? Et vous, mon frere, vous savez de quoi il s'agit, apparemment...
Comment me trouvez- vous? Ma foi, ma soeur, c'est autant de pris que le valet; mais tu pourrois bien aussi escamoter Dorante a ta maitresse.
Franchement, je ne hairois pas de lui plaire sous le personnage que je joue; je ne serois pas fachee de subjuguer sa raison, de l'etourdir un peu sur la distance qu'il y aura de lui a moi.
Si mes charmes font ce coup-la, ils me feront plaisir; je les estimerai.
D'ailleurs, cela m'aiderait a demeler Dorante.
A l'egard de son valet, je ne crains pas ses soupirs; ils n'oseront m'aborder; il y aura quelque chose dans ma physionomie qui inspirera plus de respect que d'amour a ce faquin-la.
Allons, doucement, ma soeur: ce faquin-la sera votre egal...
Et ne manquera pas de t'aimer.
Eh bien! l'honneur de lui plaire ne me sera pas inutile.
Les valets sont naturellement indiscrets; l'amour est babillard, et j'en ferai l'historien de son maitre.
Monsieur, il vient d'arriver un domestique qui demande a vous parler; il est suivi d'un crocheteur qui porte une valise.
Qu'il entre: c'est sans doute le valet de Dorante.
Son maitre peut etre reste au bureau pour affaires.
Ou est Lisette? Lisette s'habille, et dans son miroir nous trouve tres imprudents de lui livrer Dorante; elle aura bientot fait.
Doucement! on vient.
DORANTE en valet, Monsieur ORGON, SILVIA, MARIO.
Je cherche Monsieur Orgon: n'est-ce pas a lui que j'ai l'honneur de faire la reverence? Oui, mon ami, c'est a lui-meme.
Monsieur, vous avez sans doute recu de nos nouvelles; j'appartiens a monsieur Dorante, qui me suit, et qui m'envoie toujours devant, vous assurer de ses respects, en attendant qu'il vous en assure lui-meme.
Tu fais ta commission de fort bonne grace.
Lisette, que dis-tu de ce garcon-la? Moi, Monsieur, je dis qu'il est bien venu, et qu'il promet.
Vous avez bien de la bonte; je fais du mieux qu'il m'est possible.
Il n'est pas mal tourne, au moins: ton coeur n'a qu'a se bien tenir, Lisette.
Mon coeur! c'est bien des affaires.
Ne vous fachez pas, Mademoiselle; ce que dit Monsieur ne m'en fait point accroire.
Cette modestie-la me plait; continuez de meme.
Fort bien! Mais il me semble que ce nom de Mademoiselle qu'il te donne est bien serieux.
Entre gens comme vous, le style des compliments ne doit pas etre si grave; vous seriez toujours sur le qui-vive: allons, traitez-vous plus commodement.
Tu as nom Lisette; et toi, mon garcon, comment t'appelles-tu? Bourguignon, Monsieur, pour vous servir.
Eh bien! Bourguignon, soit.
Va donc pour Lisette; je n'en serai pas moins votre serviteur.
Votre serviteur! Ce n'est point encore la votre jargon: c'est "ton serviteur" qu'il faut dire.
Ah! ah! ah! ah! SILVIA, bas a Mario.
Vous me jouez, mon frere.
A l'egard du tutoiement, j'attends les ordres de Lisette.
Fais comme tu voudras, Bourguignon; voila la glace rompue, puisque cela divertit ces messieurs.
Je t'en remercie, Lisette; et je reponds sur le champ a l'honneur que tu me fais.
Courage, mes enfants! Si vous commencez a vous aimer vous voila debarrasses des ceremonies.
Oh! doucement! S'aimer, c'est une autre affaire: vous ne savez peut-etre pas que j'en veux au coeur de Lisette, moi qui vous parle.
onze est vrai qu'il m'est cruel; mais je ne veux pas que Bourguignon aille sur mes brisees.
Oui! le prenez-vous sur ce ton-la? Et moi, je veux que Bourguignon m'aime.
Tu te fais tort de dire "je veux," belle Lisette; tu n'as pas besoin d'ordonner pour etre servie.
Monsieur Bourguignon, vous avez pille cette galanterie-la quelque part.
Vous avez raison, Monsieur, c'est dans ses yeux que je l'ai prise.
Tais-toi, c'est encore pis: je te defends d'avoir tant d'esprit.
Il ne l'a pas a vos depens, et, s'il en trouve dans mes yeux, il n'a qu'a prendre.
Mon fils, vous perdrez votre proces; retirons-nous.
Dorante va venir, allons le dire a ma fille; et vous, Lisette, montrez a ce garcon l'appartement de son maitre.
Adieu, Bourguignon.
Monsieur, vous me faites trop d'honneur.
SILVIA, a part.
Ils se donnent la comedie; n'importe, mettons tout a profit.
Ce garcon-ci n'est pas sot, et je ne plains pas la soubrette qui l'aura.
II va m'en conter: laissons-le dire, pourvu qu'il m'instruise.
DORANTE, a part.
Cette fille-ci m'etonne! Il n'y a point de femme au monde a qui sa physionomie ne fit honneur: lions connoissance avec elle....
Quelle espece de suivante es-tu donc, avec ton air de princesse? Tiens, tout ce que tu dis avoir senti en me voyant est precisement l'histoire de tous les valets qui m'ont vue.
Ma foi, je ne serois pas surpris quand ce seroit aussi l'histoire de tous les maitres.
Le trait est joli, assurement; mais, je te le repete encore, je ne suis pas faite aux cajoleries de ceux dont la garde-robe ressemble a la tienne.
C'est-a-dire que ma parure ne te plait pas? Non, Bourguignon; laissons-la l'amour, et soyons bons amis.
Rien que cela? Ton petit traite n'est compose que de deux clauses impossibles.
SILVIA, a part.
Quel homme pour un valet! (Haut.) Il faut pourtant qu'il s'execute; on m'a predit que je n'epouserai jamais qu'un homme de condition, et j'ai jure depuis de n'en ecouter jamais d'autres.
Parbleu! cela est plaisant! Ce que tu as jure pour homme, je l'ai jure pour femme, moi: j'ai fait serment de n'aimer serieusement qu'une fille de condition.
Ne t'ecarte donc pas de ton projet.
Je ne m'en ecarte peut-etre pas tant que nous le croyons: tu as l'air bien distingue, et l'on est quelquefois fille de condition sans le savoir.
Ah! ha! ha! Je te remercierois de ton eloge si ma mere n'en faisoit pas les frais.
Eh bien! venge-t-en sur la mienne, si tu me trouves assez bonne mine pour cela.
SILVIA, a part.
Il le meriteroit.
(Haut.) Mais ce n'est pas la de quoi il est question: treve de badinage.
C'est un homme de condition qui m'est predit pour epoux, et je n'en rabattrai rien.
Parbleu! si j'etois tel, la prediction me menacerait; j'aurois peur de la verifier.
Je n'ai pas de foi a l'astrologie, mais j'en ai beaucoup a ton visage.
SILVIA, a part.
Il ne tarit point.
(Haut.) Finiras-tu? Que t'importe la prediction, puisqu'elle t'exclut? Elle n'a pas predit que je ne t'aimerois point.
Non, mais elle a dit que tu n'y gagnerois rien; et moi, je te le confirme.
SILVIA, a part.
Mais, en verite, voila un garcon qui me surprend, malgre que j'en aie...
(Haut.) Dis-moi, qui es-tu, toi qui me parles ainsi? Le fils d'honnetes gens qui n'etoient pas riches.
Va, je te souhaite de bon coeur une meilleure situation que la tienne, et je voudrois pouvoir y contribuer; la fortune a tort avec toi.
Ma foi! l'amour a plus de tort qu'elle: j'aimerois mieux qu'il me fut permis de te demander ton coeur que d'avoir tous les biens du monde.
SILVIA, a part.
Nous voila, grace au Ciel, en conversation reglee.
(Haut.) Bourguignon, je ne saurois me facher des discours que tu me tiens; mais, je t'en prie, changeons d'entretien.
Venons a ton maitre.
Tu peux te passer de me parler d'amour, je pense? Tu pourrais bien te passer de m'en faire sentir, toi.
Ahi! je me facherai; tu m'impatientes.
Encore une fois, laisse la ton amour.
Quitte donc ta figure.
SILVIA, a part.
A la fin, je crois qu'il m'amuse...
(Haut.) Eh bien! Bourguignon, tu ne veux donc pas finir? Faudra-t-il que je te quitte? (A part.) Je devrois deja l'avoir fait.
Attends, Lisette, je voulois moi-meme te parler d'autre chose; mais je ne sais plus ce que c'est.
J'avois de mon cote quelque chose a te dire, mais tu m'as fait perdre mes idees aussi, a moi.
Je me rappelle de t'avoir demande si ta maitresse te valoit.
Tu reviens a ton chemin par un detour: adieu.
Et non, te dis-je, Lisette; il ne s'agit ici que de mon maitre.
Eh bien! soit: je voulois te parler de lui aussi, et j'espere que tu voudras bien me dire confidemment ce qu'il est.
Ton attachement pour lui m'en donne bonne opinion: il faut qu'il ait du merite, puisque tu le sers.
Et moi je voudrois bien savoir comment il se fait que j'ai la bonte de t'ecouter, car, assurement, cela est singulier! Tu as raison, notre aventure est unique.
SILVIA, a part.
Malgre tout ce qu'il m'a dit, je ne suis point partie, je ne pars point, me voila encore, et je reponds! En verite, cela passe la raillerie.
(Haut.) Adieu.
Achevons donc ce que nous voulions dire.
Adieu, te dis-je; plus de quartier.
Quand ton maitre sera venu, je tacherai, en faveur de ma maitresse, de le connoitre par moi-meme, s'il en vaut la peine.
En attendant, tu vois cet appartement: c'est le votre.
Tiens! voici mon maitre.
Ah! te voila, Bourguignon? Mon porte-manteau et toi, avez-vous ete bien recus ici? Il n'etoit pas possible qu'on nous recut mal, Monsieur.
Un domestique la-bas m'a dit d'entrer ici, et qu'on alloit avertir mon beau-pere, qui etoit avec ma femme.
Vous voulez dire monsieur Orgon et sa fille, sans doute, Monsieur? Et oui, mon beau-pere et ma femme, autant vaut.
Je viens pour epouser, et ils m'attendent pour etre maries; cela est convenu; il ne manque plus que la ceremonie, qui est une bagatelle.
C'est une bagatelle qui vaut bien la peine qu'on y pense.
Oui; mais, quand on y a pense, on n'y pense plus.
SILVIA, bas a Dorante.
Bourguignon, on est homme de merite a bon marche chez vous, ce me semble.
Que dites-vous la a mon valet, la belle? Rien: je lui dis seulement que je vais faire descendre monsieur Orgon.
Et pourquoi ne pas dire mon beau-pere, comme moi? C'est qu'il ne l'est pas encore.
Elle a raison, Monsieur: le mariage n'est pas fait.
Eh bien! me voila pour le faire.
Attendez donc qu'il soit fait.
Pardi! voila bien des facons pour un beau-pere de la veille ou du lendemain! En effet, quelle si grande difference y a-t-il entre etre mariee ou ne l'etre pas? Oui, Monsieur, nous avons tort, et je cours informer votre beau-pere de votre arrivee.
Et ma femme aussi, je vous prie.
Mais, avant que de partir, dites-moi une chose: vous qui etes si jolie, n'etes-vous pas la soubrette de l'hotel? Vous l'avez dit.
C'est fort bien fait; je m'en rejouis.
Croyez-vous que je plaise ici? Comment me trouvez-vous? Je vous trouve ...
Bon, tant mieux; entretenez-vous dans ce sentiment-la, il pourra trouver sa place.
Vous etes bien modeste de vous en contenter.
Mais je vous quitte; il faut qu'on ait oublie d'avertir votre beau-pere, car assurement il seroit venu; et j'y vais.
Dites-lui que je l'attends avec affection.
SILVIA, a part.
Que le sort est bizarre! Aucun de ces deux hommes n'est a sa place.
Eh bien! Monsieur, mon commencement va bien: je plais deja a la soubrette.
Butor que tu es! Pourquoi donc? Mon entree est si gentille! Tu m'avois tant promis de laisser la tes facons de parler sottes et triviales! Je t'avois donne de si bonnes instructions! Je ne t'avois recommande que d'etre serieux.
Va, je vois bien que je suis un etourdi de m'en etre fie a toi.
Je ferai encore mieux dans les suites, et, puisque le serieux n'est pas suffisant, je donnerai du melancolique; je pleurerai, s'il le faut.
Je ne sais plus ou j'en suis; cette aventure-ci m'etourdit.
Que faut-il que je fasse? Est-ce que la fille n'est pas plaisante? Tais-toi; voici monsieur Orgon qui vient.
Mon cher Monsieur, je vous demande mille pardons de vous avoir fait attendre; mais ce n'est que de cet instant que j'apprends que vous etes ici.
Monsieur, mille pardons, c'est beaucoup trop, et il n'en faut qu'un quand on n'a fait qu'une faute: au surplus, tous mes pardons sont a votre service.
Je tacherai de n'en avoir pas besoin.
Vous etes le maitre, et moi votre serviteur.
Je suis, je vous assure, charme de vous voir, et je vous attendois avec impatience.
Je serois d'abord venu ici avec Bourguignon; mais, quand on arrive de voyage, vous savez qu'on est si mal bati! et j'etois bien aise de me presenter dans un etat plus ragoutant.
Vous y avez fort bien reussi.
Ma fille s'habille; elle a ete un peu indisposee.
En attendant qu'elle descende, voulez-vous vous rafraichir? Oh! je n'ai jamais refuse de trinquer avec personne.
Bourguignon, ayez soin de vous, mon garcon.
Le gaillard est gourmet: il boira du meilleur.
Qu'il ne l'epargne pas.
Eh bien! que me veux-tu, Lisette? J'ai a vous entretenir un moment.
De quoi s'agit-il? De vous dire l'etat ou sont les choses, parce qu'il est important que vous en soyez eclairci, afin que vous n'ayez point a vous plaindre de moi.
Ceci est donc bien serieux? Oui, tres serieux.
Vous avez consenti au deguisement de mademoiselle Silvia; moi-meme je l'ai trouve d'abord sans consequence, mais je me suis trompee.
Il est temps qu'elle se declare, cela presse: car, un jour plus tard, je n'en reponds plus.
Eh! d'ou vient qu'il ne voudra plus de ma fille? Quand il la connoitra, te defies-tu de ses charmes? Non; mais vous ne vous mefiez pas assez des miens.
Je vous avertis qu'ils vont leur train, et que je ne vous conseille pas de les laisser faire.
Je vous en fais mes compliments Lisette.
(Il rit.) Ah! ah! ah! Nous y voila: vous plaisantez, Monsieur, vous vous moquez de moi.
J'en suis fachee, car vous y serez pris.
Ne t'en embarrasse pas, Lisette; va ton chemin.
Je vous le repete encore, le coeur de Dorante va bien vite.
Tenez, actuellement je lui plais beaucoup, ce soir il m'aimera, il m'adorera demain.
Je ne le merite pas, il est de mauvais gout, vous en direz ce qu'il vous plaira; mais cela ne laissera pas que d'etre.
Voyez-vous, demain je me garantis adoree.
Eh bien! que vous importe? S'il vous aime tant, qu'il vous epouse.
Quoi! vous ne l'en empecheriez pas? Non, d'homme d'honneur, si tu le menes jusque la.
Monsieur, prenez-y garde.
Jusqu'ici je n'ai pas aide a mes appats, je les ai laisse faire tout seuls, j'ai menage sa tete: si je m'en mele, je la renverse, il n'y aura plus de remede.
Renverse, ravage, brule, enfin epouse, je te le permets, si tu le peux.
Sur ce pied-la, je compte ma fortune faite.
Et moi, je te le defends.
J'evite de m'expliquer avec elle; j'ai mes raisons pour faire durer ce deguisement: je veux qu'elle examine son futur plus a loisir.
Mais le valet, comment se gouberne-t-il? ne se  mele-t-il pas d'aimer ma fille? C'est un original: j'ai remarque qu'il fait l'homme de consequence avec elle, parce qu'il est bien fait; il la regarde, et soupire.
Et cela la fache.
Mais...
elle rougit.
Bon, tu te trompes: les regards d'un valet ne l'embarrassent pas jusque la.
Monsieur, elle rougit.
C'est donc d'indignation.
A la bonne heure.
Eh bien! quand tu lui parleras, dis-lui que tu soupconnes ce valet de la prevenir contre son maitre; et, si elle se fache, ne t'en inquiete point: ce sont mes affaires.
Mais voici Dorante, qui te cherche apparemment.
Ah! je vous trouve, merveilleuse dame! je vous demandois a tout le monde.
Serviteur, cher beau-pere, ou peu s'en faut.
Adieu, mes enfants: je vous laisse ensemble; il est bon que vous vous aimiez un peu avant que de vous marier.
Je ferois bien ces deux besognes-la a la fois, moi.
Point d'impatience.
Madame, il dit que je ne m'impatiente pas; il en parle bien a son aise, le bonhomme! J'ai de la peine a croire qu'il vous en coute tant d'attendre, Monsieur; c'est par galanterie que vous faites l'impatient: a peine etes-vous arrive.
Votre amour ne sauroit etre bien fort: ce n'est tout au plus qu'un amour naissant.
Vous vous trompez, prodige de nos jours: un amour de votre facon ne reste pas longtemps au berceau; votre premier coup d'oeil a fait naitre le mien, le second lui a donne des forces, et le troisieme l'a rendu grand garcon.
Tachons de l'etablir au plus vite; ayez soin de lui, puisque vous etes sa mere.
Trouvez-vous qu'on le maltraite? est-il si abandonne? En attendant qu'il soit pourvu, donnez-lui seulement votre belle main blanche pour l'amuser un peu.
Tenez donc, petit importun, puisqu'on ne sauroit avoir la paix qu'en vous amusant.
ARLEQUIN, lui baisant la main.
Cher joujou de mon ame! cela me rejouit comme du vin delicieux.
Quel dommage de n'en avoir que roquille! Allons, arretez-vous; vous etes trop avide.
Je ne demande qu'a me soutenir, en attendant que je vive.
Ne faut-il pas avoir de la raison? De la raison! Helas! je l'ai perdue; vos beaux yeux sont les filous qui me l'ont volee.
Mais est-il possible que vous m'aimiez tant? Je ne saurois me le persuader.
Je ne me soucie pas de ce qui est possible, moi, mais je vous aime comme un perdu, et vous verrez bien dans votre miroir que cela est juste.
Mon miroir ne servirait qu'a me rendre plus incredule.
Ah! mignonne, adorable! votre humilite ne seroit donc qu'une hypocrite! Quelqu'un vient a nous: c'est votre valet.
Monsieur, pourrois-je vous entretenir un moment? Non: maudite soit la valetaille qui ne sauroit nous laisser en repos! Voyez ce qu'il vous veut, Monsieur.
Je n'ai qu'un mot a vous dire.
Madame, s'il en dit deux, son conge sera le troisieme.
Voyons! DORANTE, bas a Arlequin.
Viens donc, impertinent! ARLEQUIN, bas a Dorante.
Ce sont des injures, et non pas des mots, cela...
(A Lisette) Ma reine, excusez.
Faites, faites.
Debarrasse-moi de tout ceci.
Ne te livre point; parois serieux et reveur, et meme mecontent: entends-tu? Oui, mon ami; ne vous inquietez pas, et retirez-vous.
Ah! Madame! sans lui j'allois vous dire de belles choses, et je n'en trouverai plus que de communes a cette heure, hormis mon amour, qui est extraordinaire.
Mais, a propos de mon amour, quand est-ce que le votre lui tiendra compagnie? Il faut esperer que cela viendra.
Et croyez-vous que cela vienne? La question est vive: savez-vous bien que vous m'embarrassez? Que voulez-vous? je brule, et je crie au feu.
S'il m'etoit permis de m'expliquer si vite...
Je suis du sentiment que vous le pouvez en conscience.
La retenue de mon sexe ne le veut pas.
Ce n'est donc pas la retenue d'a present, qui donne bien d'autres permissions.
Mais que me demandez-vous? Dites-moi un petit brin que vous m'aimez.
Tenez, je vous aime, moi.
Faites l'echo: repetez, Princesse.
Quel insatiable! Eh bien! Monsieur, je vous aime.
Eh bien! Madame, je me meurs, mon bonheur me confond, j'ai peur d'en courir les champs.
Vous m'aimez! cela est admirable! J'aurois lieu, a mon tour, d'etre etonnee de la promptitude de votre hommage.
Peut-etre m'aimerez-vous moins quand nous nous connoitrons mieux.
Ah! Madame, quand nous en serons la, j'y perdrai beaucoup, il y aura bien a decompter.
Vous me croyez plus de qualites que je n'en ai.
Et vous, Madame, vous ne savez pas les miennes, et je ne devrois vous parler qu'a genoux.
Souvenez-vous qu'on n'est pas les maitres de son sort.
Les peres et meres font tout a leur tete.
Pour moi, mon coeur vous auroit choisi, dans quelque etat que vous eussiez ete.
Il a beau jeu pour me choisir encore.
Puis-je me flatter que vous etes de meme a mon egard? Helas! quand vous ne seriez que Perrette ou Margot, quand je vous aurois vue, le martinet a la main, descendre a la cave, vous auriez toujours ete ma princesse.
Puissent de si beaux sentiments etre durables! Pour les fortifier de part et d'autre, jurons-nous de nous aimer toujours, en depit de toutes les fautes d'orthographe que vous aurez faites sur mon compte.
J'ai plus d'interet a ce serment-la que vous, et je le fais de tout mon coeur.
ARLEQUIN se met a genoux.
Votre bonte m'eblouit, et je me prosterne devant elle.
Arretez-vous! Je ne saurais vous souffrir dans cette posture-la; je serois ridicule de vous y laisser: levez-vous.
Voila encore quelqu'un.
Que voulez-vous, Lisette? J'aurois a vous parler, Madame.
Ne voila-t-il pas! He! ma mie, revenez dans un quart d'heure, allez: les femmes de chambre de mon pays n'entrent point qu'on ne les appelle.
Monsieur, il faut que je parle a Madame.
Mais voyez l'opiniatre soubrette! Reine de ma vie, renvoyez-la.
Retournez- vous en, ma fille; nous avons ordre de nous aimer avant qu'on nous marie; n'interrompez point nos fonctions.
Ne pouvez-vous pas revenir dans un moment, Lisette? Mais, Madame...
Mais, ce mais-la n'est bon qu'a me donner la fievre.
SILVIA, a part.
Ah! le vilain homme! (Haut.) Madame, je vous assure que cela est presse.
Permettez donc que je m'en defasse, Monsieur.
Puisque le diable le veut, et elle aussi...
Patience...
je me promenerai en attendant qu'elle ait fait.
Fort bien; mais, puisqu'il n'y est plus, ecoutez-moi comme votre maitresse.
Vous voyez bien que cet homme-la ne me convient point.
Vous n'avez pas eu le temps de l'examiner beaucoup.
Etes-vous folle, avec votre examen? Est-il necessaire de le voir deux fois pour juger du peu de convenance? En un mot, je n'en veux point.
Apparemment que mon pere n'approuve pas la repugnance qu'il me voit, car il me fuit et ne me dit mot.
Dans cette conjoncture, c'est a vous a me tirer tout doucement d'affaire en temoignant adroitement a ce jeune homme que vous n'etes pas dans le gout de l'epouser.
Je ne saurois, Madame.
Vous ne sauriez? Et qu'est-ce qui vous en empeche? Monsieur Orgon me l'a defendu.
Il vous l'a defendu! Mais je ne reconnois point mon pere a ce procede-la! Positivement defendu.
Eh bien! je vous charge de lui dire mes degouts et de l'assurer qu'ils sont invincibles.
Je ne saurois me persuader qu'apres cela il veuille pousser les choses plus loin.
Mais, Madame, le futur, qu'a-t-il donc de si desagreable,  de si rebutant? Il me deplait, vous dis-je, et votre peu de zele aussi.
Donnez-vous le temps de voir ce qu'il est: voila tout ce qu'on vous demande.
Je le hais assez sans prendre du temps pour le hair davantage.
Son valet, qui fait l'important, ne vous auroit-il point gate l'esprit sur son compte? Hum! la sotte! son valet a bien affaire ici! C'est que je me mefie de lui, car il est raisonneur.
Finissez vos portraits, on n'en a que faire.
J'ai soin que ce valet me parle peu, et, dans le peu qu'il m'a dit, il ne m'a jamais rien dit que de tres sage.
Je crois qu'il est homme a vous avoir conte des histoires maladroites pour faire briller son bel esprit.
Oh! Madame, des que vous le defendez sur ce ton-la, et que cela va jusqu'a vous facher, je n'ai plus rien a dire.
Eh bien! si ce valet n'a rien dit, a la bonne heure; il ne faut pas vous emporter pour le justifier; je vous crois, voila qui est fini; je ne m'oppose pas a la bonne opinion que vous en avez, moi.
Voyez-vous le mauvais esprit! comme elle tourne les choses! Je me sens dans une indignation...
qui...
va jusqu'aux larmes.
Elle a des facons de parler qui me mettent hors de moi.
Retirez-vous, vous m'etes insupportable; laissez-moi, je prendrai d'autres mesures.
Je frissonne encore de ce que je lui ai entendu dire.
Avec quelle impudence les domestiques ne nous traitent-ils pas dans leur esprit! Comme ces gens-la vous degradent! Je ne saurois m'en remettre; je n'oserois songer aux termes dont elle s'est servie: ils me font toujours peur.
Il s'agit d'un valet! Ah! l'etrange chose! Ecartons l'idee dont cette insolente est venue me noircir l'imagination.
Voici Bourguignon, voila cet objet en question pour lequel je m'emporte; mais ce n'est pas sa faute, le pauvre garcon! et je ne dois pas m'en prendre a lui.
Lisette, quelque eloignement que tu aies pour moi, je suis force de te parler; je crois que j'ai a me plaindre de toi.
Bourguignon, ne nous tutoyons plus, je t'en prie.
Comme tu voudras.
Tu n'en fais pourtant rien.
Ni toi non plus; tu me dis: "Je t'en prie." C'est que cela m'est echappe.
Eh bien! crois-moi, parlons comme nous pourrons: ce n'est pas la peine de nous gener pour le peu de temps que nous avons a nous voir.
Est-ce que ton maitre s'en va? Il n'y auroit pas grande perte.
Ni a moi non plus, n'est-il pas vrai? J'acheve ta pensee.
Je l'acheverois bien moi-meme, si j'en avois envie; mais je ne songe pas a toi.
Et moi, je ne te perds point de vue.
Mon malheur est inconcevable: tu m'otes peut-etre tout le repos de ma vie.
Quelle fantaisie il s'est alle mettre dans l'esprit! Il me fait de la peine.
Reviens a toi.
Tu me parles, je te reponds: c'est beaucoup, c'est trop meme, tu peux m'en croire, et, si tu etois instruit, en verite, tu serois content de moi; tu me trouverais d'une bonte sans exemple, d'une bonte que je blamerois dans une autre.
A la fin, cela ne ressembleroit plus a rien.
Ainsi, finissons, Bourguignon; finissons, je t'en prie.
Qu'est-ce que cela signifie? C'est se moquer.
Allons, qu'il n'en soit plus parle.
Ah! ma chere Lisette, que je souffre! Venons a ce que te voulois me dire.
Tu te plaignois de moi quand tu es entre: de quoi etoit-il question? De rien, d'une bagatelle; j'avois envie de te voir, et je crois que je n'ai pris qu'un pretexte.
SILVIA, a part.
Que dire a cela? Quand je m'en facherois, il n'en seroit ni plus ni moins.
Ta maitresse, en partant, a paru m'accuser de t'avoir parle au desavantage de mon maitre.
Elle se l'imagine, et, si elle t'en parle encore, tu peux le nier hardiment; je me charge du reste.
Eh! ce n'est pas cela qui m'occupe.
Si tu n'as que cela a me dire, nous n'avons plus que faire ensemble.
Laisse-moi du moins le plaisir de te voir.
Le beau motif qu'il me fournit la! J'amuserai la passion de Bourguignon! Le souvenir de tout ceci me fera bien rire un jour.
Tu me railles, tu as raison: je ne sais ce que je dis ni ce que je te demande.
Adieu; tu prends le bon parti...
Mais, a propos de tes adieux, il me reste encore une chose a savoir.
Vous partez, m'as-tu dit...
Cela est-il serieux? Pour moi, il faut que je parte, ou que la tete me tourne.
Je ne t'arretois pas pour cette reponse-la, par exemple.
Et je n'ai fait qu'une faute: c'est de n'etre pas parti des que je t'ai vue.
SILVIA, a part.
J'ai besoin a tout moment d'oublier que je l'ecoute.
Si tu savois, Lisette, l'etat ou je me trouve...
Oh! il n'est pas si curieux a savoir que le mien, je t'en assure.
Que peux-tu me reprocher? Je ne me propose pas de te rendre sensible.
SILVIA, a part.
Iun ne faudroit pas s'y fier.
Et que pourrois-je esperer en tachant de me faire aimer? Helas! quand meme j'aurois ton coeur.
Que le Ciel m'en preserve! Quand tu l'aurois, tu ne le saurois pas, et je ferois si bien que je ne le saurois pas moi-meme.
Tenez, quelle idee il lui vient la! Il est donc bien vrai que tu ne me hais, ni ne m'aimes, ni ne m'aimeras? Sans difficulte.
Sans difficulte! Qu'ai-je donc de si affreux? Rien: ce n'est pas la ce qui te nuit.
Eh bien! chere Lisette, dis-le moi cent fois, que tu ne m'aimeras point.
Oh! je te l'ai assez dit! Tache de me croire.
(Il se jette a genoux.
Dans ce moment, Monsieur Orgon et Mario entrent, et ne disent mot.) Ah! nous y voila! il ne manquoit plus que cette facon-la a mon aventure! Que je suis malheureuse! C'est ma facilite qui le place la.
Leve-toi donc, Bourguignon, je t'en conjure: il peut venir quelqu'un.
Je dirai ce qu'il te plaira.
Que me veux-tu? Je ne te hais point.
Leve-toi; je t'aimerois si je pouvois; tu ne me deplais point, cela doit te suffire.
Quoi! Lisette, si je n'etois pas ce que je suis, si j'etois riche, d'une condition honnete, et que je t'aimasse autant que je t'aime, ton coeur n'auroit point de repugnance pour moi? Assurement.
Tu ne me hairois pas? tu me souffrirois? Volontiers....
Mais leve-toi.
Tu parois le dire serieusement, et, si cela est, ma raison est perdue, Je dis ce que tu veux, et tu ne te leves point! Monsieur ORGON, s'approchant.
C'est bien dommage de vous interrompre: cela, va a merveille, mes enfants; courage.
Vous le voulez bien, Bourguignon? Je me retire, Monsieur.
Allez, et tachez de parler de votre maitre avec un peu plus de menagement que vous ne faites.
Moi, Monsieur? Vous-meme, monsieur Bourguignon; vous ne brillez pas trop dans le respect que vous avez pour votre maitre, dit-on.
Je ne sais ce qu'on veut dire.
Adieu, adieu; vous vous justifierez une autre fois.
Eh bien! Silvia, vous ne nous regardez pas; vous avez l'air tout embarrasse.
Moi, mon pere! et ou seroit le motif de mon embarras? Je suis, grace au Ciel, comme a mon ordinaire; je suis fachee de vous dire que c'est une idee.
II y a quelque chose, ma soeur, il y a quelque chose.
Quelque chose dans votre tete, a la bonne heure, mon frere; mais, pour dans la mienne, il n'y a que l'etonnement  de ce que vous dites.
C'est donc ce garcon qui vient de sortir qui t'inspire cette extreme antipathie que tu as pour son maitre? Qui? le domestique de Dorante? Oui, le galant Bourguignon.
Le galant Bourguignon, dont je ne savois pas l'epithete, ne me parle pas de lui.
Cependant on pretend que c'est lui qui le detruit aupres de toi, et c'est sur quoi j'etois bien aise de te parler.
Ce n'est pas la peine, mon pere, et personne au monde que son maitre ne m'a donne l'aversion naturelle que j'ai pour lui.
Ma foi, tu as beau dire, ma soeur, elle est trop forte pour etre si naturelle, et quelqu'un y a aide.
SILVIA, avec vivacite.
Avec quel air mysterieux vous me dites cela, mon frere! Et qui est donc ce quelqu'un qui y a aide? Voyons.
Dans quelle humeur es-tu, ma soeur? Comme tu t'emportes! C'est que je suis bien lasse de mon personnage, et je me serois deja demasquee si je n'avois pas craint de facher mon pere.
Gardez-vous en bien, ma fille; je viens ici pour vous le recommander.
Puisque j'ai eu la complaisance de vous permettre votre deguisement, il faut, s'il vous plait, que vous ayez celle de suspendre votre jugement sur Dorante, et de voir si l'aversion qu'on vous a donnee pour lui est legitime.
Vous ne m'ecoutez donc point, mon pere?...
Je vous dis qu'on ne me l'a point donnee.
Quoi! ce babillard qui vient de sortir ne t'a pas un peu degoutee de lui? SILVIA, avec feu.
Que vos discours sont desobligeants! M'a degoutee de lui! degoutee! J'essuie des expressions bien etranges, je n'entends plus que des choses inouies, qu'un langage inconcevable: j'ai l'air embarrasse, il y a quelque chose, et puis c'est le galant Bourguignon qui m'a degoutee.
C'est tout ce qui vous plaira; mais je n'y entends rien.
Pour le coup, c'est toi qui es etrange.
A qui en as-tu donc? D'ou vient que tu es si fort sur le qui-vive? Dans quelle idee nous soupconnes-tu? Courage, mon frere...
Par quelle fatalite aujourd'hui ne pouvez-vous me dire un mot qui ne me choque? Quel soupcon voulez-vous qui me vienne? Avez-vous des visions? Il est vrai que tu es si agitee que je ne te reconnois point non plus.
Ce sont apparemment ces mouvements-la qui sont cause que Lisette nous a parle comme elle a fait.
Elle accusoit ce valet de ne t'avoir pas entretenue a l'avantage de son maitre, "et Madame, nous a-t-elle dit, l'a defendu contre moi avec tant de colere que j'en suis encore toute surprise"; et c'est sur ce mot de "surprise" que nous l'avons querellee.
Mais ces gens-la ne savent pas la consequence d'un mot.
L'impertinente! Y a-t-il rien de plus haissable que cette fille-la? J'avoue que je me suis fachee, par un esprit de justice pour ce garcon.
Je ne vois point de mal a cela.
Doucement donc! Non, Monsieur, il n'y a point de douceur qui tienne.
Comment donc? des surprises, des consequences! Eh! qu'on s'explique: que veut-on dire? On accuse ce valet, et on a tort; vous vous trompez tous, Lisette est une folle, il est innocent, et voila qui est fini.
Pourquoi donc m'en reparler encore? car je suis outree! Tu te retiens, ma fille; tu aurois grande envie de me quereller aussi.
Mais faisons mieux: il n'y a que ce valet qui est suspect ici, Dorante n'a qu'a le chasser.
Quel malheureux deguisement! Surtout que Lisette ne m'approche pas! Je la hais plus que Dorante.
Tu la verras si tu veux; mais tu dois etre charmee que ce garcon s'en aille, car il t'aime, et cela t'importune assurement.
Je n'ai point a m'en plaindre: il me prend pour une suivante, et il me parle sur ce ton-la; mais il ne me dit pas ce qu'il veut, j'y mets bon ordre.
Tu n'en es pas tant la maitresse que tu le dis bien.
Ne l'avons-nous pas vu se mettre a genoux malgre toi? N'as-tu pas ete obligee, pour le faire lever, de lui dire qu'il ne te deplaisoit pas? SILVIA, a part.
Encore a-t-il fallu, quand il t'a demande si tu l'aimerois, que tu aies tendrement ajoute: "Volontiers"; sans quoi il y seroit encore.
L'heureuse apostille, mon frere! Mais, comme l'action m'a deplu, la repetition n'en est pas aimable.
Ah ca, parlons serieusement: quand finira la comedie que vous vous donnez sur mon compte? La seule chose que j'exige de toi, ma fille, c'est de ne te determiner a le refuser qu'avec connoissance de cause.
Attends encore.
Tu me remercieras du delai que je demande, je t'en reponds.
Tu epouseras Dorante, et meme avec inclination, je te le predis...
Mais, mon pere, je vous demande grace pour le valet.
Pourquoi grace? Et moi, je veux qu'il sorte.
Son maitre en decidera.
Allons-nous en.
Adieu, adieu, ma soeur, sans rancune.
SILVIA, seule; DORANTE, qui vint peu apres.
Ah! que j'ai le coeur serre! Je ne sais ce qui se mele a l'embarras ou je me trouve: tout cette aventure-ci m'afflige; je me defie de tous les visages; je ne suis contente de personne, je ne le suis pas de moi-meme.
Ah! je te cherchois, Lisette.
Ce n'etoit pas la peine de me trouver, car je te fuis, moi.
DORANTE, l'empechant de sortir.
Arrete donc, Lisette! J'ai a te parler pour la derniere fois: il s'agit d'une chose de consequence qui regarde tes maitres.
Va la dire a eux-memes: je ne te vois jamais que tu ne me chagrines; laisse-moi.
Je t'en offre autant; mais ecoute-moi, te dis-je: tu vas voir les choses bien changer de face par ce que je te vais dire, Eh bien! parle donc; je t'ecoute, puisqu'il est arrete que ma complaisance pour toi sera eternelle.
Me promets-tu le secret? Je n'ai jamais trahi personne.
Tu ne dois la confidence que je vais te faire qu'a l'estime que j'ai pour toi.
Je le crois, mais tache de m'estimer sans me le dire, car cela sent le pretexte.
Tu te trompes, Lisette.
Tu m'as promis le secret: achevons.
Tu m'as vu dans de grands mouvements; je n'ai pu me defendre de t'aimer.
Nous y voila.
Je me defendrai bien de t'entendre, moi! Adieu.
Reste: ce n'est plus Bourguignon qui te parle.
Eh! qui es-tu donc? Ah! Lisette, c'est ici ou tu vas juger des peines qu'a du ressentir mon coeur! Ce n'est pas a ton coeur a qui je parle: c'est a toi.
Personne ne vient-il? Non.
L'etat ou sont les choses me force a te le dire; je suis trop honnete homme pour n'en pas arreter le cours.
Sache que celui qui est avec ta maitresse n'est pas ce qu'on pense.
SILVIA, vivement.
Qui est-il donc? Un valet.
Apres? C'est moi qui suis Dorante.
SILVIA, a part.
Ah! je vois clair dans mon coeur.
Je voulois sous cet habit penetrer un peu ce que c'etoit que ta maitresse avant que de l'epouser.
Mon pere, en partant, me permit ce que j'ai fait, et l'evenement m'en paroit un songe: je hais ta maitresse, dont je devois etre l'epoux, et j'aime la suivante, qui ne devoit trouver en moi qu'un nouveau maitre.
Que faut-il que je fasse a present? Je rougis pour elle de le dire; mais ta maitresse a si peu de gout qu'elle est eprise de mon valet, au point qu'elle l'epousera si on la laisse faire.
Quel parti prendre.
SILVIA, a part.
Cachons-lui qui je suis...
(Haut.) Votre situation est neuve, assurement! Mais, Monsieur, je vous fais d'abord mes excuses de tout ce que mes discours ont pu avoir d'irregulier dans nos entretiens.
DORANTE, vivement.
Tais-toi, Lisette; tes excuses me chagrinent: elles me rappellent la distance qui nous separe, et ne me la rendent que plus douloureuse.
Un coeur qui m'a choisie dans la condition ou je suis est assurement bien digne qu'on l'accepte, et je le paierois volontiers du mien si je ne craignois pas de le jeter dans un engagement qui lui feroit tort.
N'as-tu pas assez de charmes, Lisette? y ajoutes-tu encore la noblesse avec laquelle tu me parles.
J'entends quelqu'un.
Patientez encore sur l'article de votre valet; les choses n'iront pas si vite; nous nous reverrons, et nous chercherons les moyens de vous tirer d'affaire.
Je suivrai tes conseils.
(Il sort.) Allons, j'avois grand besoin que ce fut la Dorante.
Je viens te retrouver, ma soeur.
Nous t'avons laissee dans des inquietudes qui me touchent: je veux t'en tirer; ecoute-moi.
SILVIA, vivement.
Ah! vraiment, mon frere, il y a bien d'autres nouvelles! Qu'est-ce que c'est? Ce n'est point Bourguignon, mon frere; c'est Dorante.
Duquel parlez-vous donc? De lui, vous dis-je; je viens de l'apprendre tout a l'heure.
Il sort; il me l'a dit lui-meme.
Qui donc? Vous ne m'entendez donc pas? Si j'y comprends rien, je veux mourir.
Venez, sortons d'ici; allons trouver mon pere: il faut qu'il le sache, j'aurai besoin de vous aussi, mon frere.
Il me vient de nouvelles idees.
Il faudra feindre de m'aimer; vous en avez deja dit quelque chose en badinant; mais surtout gardez bien le secret, je vous prie.
Oh! je le garderai bien, car je ne sais ce que c'est.
Allons, mon frere, venez; ne perdons point de temps.
Il n'est jamais rien arrive d'egal a cela! Je prie le Ciel qu'elle n'extravague pas.
Helas! Monsieur, mon tres honore maitre, je vous en conjure...
Encore! Ayez compassion de ma bonne aventure; ne portez point guignon a mon bonheur, qui va son train si rondement; ne lui fermez point le passage.
Allons donc, miserable! je crois que tu te moques de moi! Tu meriterois cent coups de baton.
Je ne les refuse point si je les merite; mais, quand je les aurai recus, permettez-moi d'en meriter d'autres.
Voulez-vous que j'aille chercher le baton? Maraud! Maraud soit; mais cela n'est point contraire a faire fortune.
Ce coquin! quelle imagination il lui prend! Coquin est encore bon, il me convient aussi: un maraud n'est point deshonore d'etre appele coquin: mais un coquin peut faire un bon mariage.
Cette demoiselle m'adore, elle m'idolatre...
Si je lui dis mon etat de valet, et que nonobstant son tendre coeur soit toujours friand de la noce avec moi, ne laisserez-vous pas jouer les violons? Des qu'on te connoitra, je ne m'en embarrasse plus.
Bon! et je vais de ce pas prevenir cette genereuse personne sur mon habit de caractere.
J'espere que ce ne sera pas un galon de couleur qui nous brouillera ensemble, et que son amour me fera passer a la table, en depit du sort, qui ne m'a mis qu'au buffet.
DORANTE, seul, et ensuite MARIO.
Tout ce qui se passe ici, tout ce qui m'y est arrive a moi-meme, est incroyable...
Je voudrais pourtant bien voir Lisette, et savoir le succes de ce qu'elle m'a promis de faire aupres de sa maitresse pour me tirer d'embarras.
Allons voir si je pourrai la trouver seule.
Arretez, Bourguignon! j'ai un mot a vous dire.
Qu'y a-t-il pour votre service, Monsieur? Vous en contez a Lisette? Elle est si aimable qu'on auroit de la peine a ne lui pas parler d'amour.
Comment recoit-elle ce que vous lui dites? Monsieur, elle en badine.
Tu as de l'esprit.
Ne fais-tu pas l'hypocrite? Non; mais qu'est-ce que cela vous fait? Suppose que Lisette eut du gout pour moi...
Du gout pour lui! Ou prenez-vous vos termes? Vous avez le langage bien precieux pour un garcon de votre espece! Monsieur, je ne saurais parler autrement.
C'est apparemment avec ces petites delicatesses-la que vous attaquez Lisette? Cela imite l'homme de condition.
Je vous assure, Monsieur, que je n'imite personne; mais sans doute que vous ne venez pas expres pour me traiter de ridicule, et vous aviez autre chose a me dire.
Nous parlions de Lisette, de mon inclination pour elle, et de l'interet que vous y prenez, Comment, morbleu! il y a deja un ton de jalousie dans ce que tu me reponds! Modere-toi un peu.
Eh bien! Tu me disois qu'en supposant que Lisette eut du gout pour toi...
Ma foi, je vous crois: car Bourguignon, tout Bourguignon qu'il est, n'est pas meme content que vous soyez le sien.
Il prendra patience.
Il faudra bien.
Mais, Monsieur, vous l'aimez donc beaucoup? Assez pour m'attacher serieusement a elle des que j'aurai pris de certaines mesures.
Comprends-tu ce que cela signifie? Oui, je crois que je suis au fait.
Vous m'etonnez, Monsieur: Lisette ne sait donc pas vos desseins? Lisette sait tout le bien que je lui veux, et n'y paroit pas  sensible; mais j'espere que la raison me gagnera son coeur.
Adieu, retire-toi sans bruit: son indifference pour moi, malgre tout ce que je lui offre, doit te consoler du sacrifice que tu me feras....
Ta livree n'est pas propre a faire pencher la balance en ta faveur, et tu n'es pas fait pour lutter contre moi.
Ah! te voila, Lisette? Qu'avez-vous, Monsieur? vous me paroissez emu.
Ce n'est rien: je disois un mot a Bourguignon.
Il est triste: est-ce que vous le querelliez? Monsieur m'apprend qu'il vous aime, Lisette...
Ce n'est pas ma faute.
Et me defend de vous aimer.
Il me defend donc de vous paroitre aimable? Je ne saurais empecher qu'il ne t'aime, belle Lisette; mais je ne veux pas qu'il te le dise.
Il ne me le dit plus, il ne fait que me le repeter.
Du moins ne te le repetera-t-il pas quand je serai present.
Retirez-vous, Bourguignon.
J'attends qu'elle me l'ordonne.
Encore! Il dit qu'il attend: ayez donc patience.
Avez-vous de l'inclination pour Monsieur? Quoi! de l'amour? Oh! je crois qu'il ne sera pas necessaire qu'on me le defende.
Ne me trompez-vous pas? En verite, je joue ici un joli personnage! Qu'il sorte donc! A qui est-ce que je parle? A Bourguignon, voila tout.
Eh bien! qu'il s'en aille! DORANTE, a part.
Je souffre.
Cedez, puisqu'il se fache.
DORANTE, bas a Silvia.
Vous ne demandez peut-etre pas mieux? Allons, finissons.
Vous ne m'aviez pas dit cet amour-la, Lisette.
Si je n'aimois pas cet homme-la, avouons que je serois bien ingrate.
MARIO, riant.
Ha! ha! ha! ha! De quoi riez-vous, Mario? De la colere de Dorante, qui sort, et que j'ai oblige de quitter Lisette.
Mais que vous a-t-il dit dans le petit entretien que vous avez eu tete a tete avec lui? Je n'ai jamais vu d'homme ni plus intrigue ni de plus mauvaise humeur.
Je ne suis pas fache qu'il soit la dupe de son propre stratageme; et d'ailleurs, a le bien prendre, il n'y a rien de plus flatteur ni de plus obligeant pour lui que tout ce que tu as fait jusqu'ici, ma fille.
Mais en voila assez.
Mais ou en est-il precisement, ma soeur? Helas! mon frere, je vous avoue que j'ai lieu d'etre contente.
"Helas! mon frere," me dit-elle.
Sentez-vous cette paix douce qui se mele a ce qu'elle dit? Quoi! ma fille, tu esperes qu'il ira jusqu'a t'offrir sa main dans le deguisement ou te voila? Oui, mon cher pere, je l'espere.
Friponne que tu es, avec ton "cher pere"! Tu ne nous grondes plus a present, tu nous dis des douceurs.
Vous ne me passez rien.
Ha! ha! je prends ma revanche.
Tu m'as tantot chicane sur les expressions: il faut bien, a mon tour, que je badine un peu sur les tiennes; ta joie est bien aussi divertissante que l'etoit ton inquietude.
Vous n'aurez point a vous plaindre de moi, ma fille: j'acquiesce a tout ce qui vous plait.
Ah! Monsieur, si vous saviez combien je vous aurai d'obligation! Dorante et moi nous sommes destines l'un a l'autre; il doit m'epouser.
Vous avez fonde notre bonheur pour la vie en me laissant faire: c'est un mariage unique; c'est une aventure dont le seul recit est attendrissant; c'est le coup de hasard le plus singulier, le plus heureux, le plus...
Ha! ha! ha! que ton coeur a de caquet, ma soeur! quelle eloquence! If faut convenir que le regal que tu te donnes est charmant, surtout si tu acheves.
Cela vaut fait, Dorante est vaincu: j'attends mon captif.
Ses fers seront plus dores qu'il ne pense.
Mais je lui crois l'ame en peine, et j'ai pitie de ce qu'il souffre.
Ce qui lui en coute a se determiner ne me le rend que plus estimable: il pense qu'il chagrinera son pere en m'epousant; il croit trahir sa fortune et sa naissance.
Voila de grands sujets de reflexion: je serai charmee de triompher.
Mais il faut que j'arrache ma victoire, et non pas qu'il me la donne; je veux un combat entre l'amour et la raison.
Et que la raison y perisse.
C'est-a-dire que tu veux qu'il sente toute l'etendue de 'impertinence qu'il croira faire.
Quelle insatiable vanite d'amour-propre! Cela, c'est l'amour-propre d'une femme, et il est tout au plus uni.
Paix! voici Lisette.
Voyons ce qu'elle nous veut.
Monsieur, vous m'avez dit tantot que vous m'abandonniez Dorante, que vous livriez sa tete a ma discretion: je vous ai pris au mot, j'ai travaille comme pour moi, et vous verrez de l'ouvrage bien fait, allez; c'est une tete bien conditionnee.
Quoi? vous voulez bien que je l'epouse? Monsieur le veut bien aussi? Oui, qu'il s'accommode.
Pourquoi t'aime-t-il? J'y consens aussi, moi.
Moi aussi, et je vous en remercie tous.
Attends; j'y mets pourtant une petite restriction; c'est qu'il faudroit, pour nous disculper de ce qui arrivera, que tu lui dises un peu qui tu es.
Mais, si je lui dis un peu, il le saura tout-a-fait.
Eh bien! cette tete en si bon etat ne soutiendra-t-elle pas cette secousse-la? Je ne le crois pas de caractere a s'effaroucher la- dessus.
Le voici qui me cherche; ayez donc la bonte de me laisser le champ libre: il s'agit ici de mon chef-d'oeuvre.
Cela est juste: retirons-nous.
De tout mon coeur.
Enfin, ma reine, je vous vois, et je ne vous quitte plus, car j'ai trop pati d'avoir manque de votre presence, et j'ai cru que vous esquiviez la mienne.
Il faut vous avouer, Monsieur, qu'il en etoit quelque chose.
Comment donc! ma chere ame, elixir de mon coeur, avez-vous entrepris la fin de ma vie? Non, mon cher, la duree m'en est trop precieuse.
Ah! que ces paroles me fortifient! Et vous ne devez point douter de ma tendresse.
Je voudrois bien pouvoir baiser ces petits mots-la, et les cueillir sur votre bouche avec la mienne.
Mais vous me pressiez sur notre mariage, et mon pere ne m'avoit pas encore permis de vous repondre.
Je viens de lui parler, et j'ai son aveu pour vous dire que vous pouvez lui demander ma main quand vous voudrez.
Avant que je la demande a lui, souffrez que je la demande a vous: je veux lui rendre mes graces de la charite qu'elle aura de vouloir bien entrer dans la mienne, qui en est veritablement indigne.
Je ne refuse pas de vous la preter un moment, a condition que vous la prendrez pour toujours.
Chere petite main rondelette et potelee, je vous prends sans marchander; je ne suis pas en peine de l'honneur que vous me ferez, il n'y a que celui que je vous rendrai qui m'inquiete.
Vous m'en rendrez plus qu'il ne m'en faut.
Ah! que nenni: vous ne savez pas cette arithmetique-la aussi bien que moi.
Je regarde pourtant votre amour comme un present du ciel.
Le present qu'il vous a fait ne le ruinera pas; il est bien mesquin.
Je ne le trouve que trop magnifique.
C'est que vous ne le voyez pas au grand jour.
Vous ne sauriez croire combien votre modestie m'embarrasse.
Ne faites point depense d'embarras: je serois bien effronte si je n'etois pas modeste.
Enfin, Monsieur, faut-il vous dire que c'est moi que votre tendresse honore? Ahi! ahi! je ne sais plus ou me mettre.
Encore une fois.
Monsieur, je me connois.
He! je me connois bien aussi; et je n'ai pas la une fameuse connoissance, ni vous non plus, quand vous l'aurez faite; mais c'est la le diable que de me connoitre: vous ne vous attendez pas au fond du sac.
LISETTE, a part.
Tant d'abaissement n'est pas naturel! (Haut) D'ou vient me dites-vous cela? Et voila ou git le lievre.
Mais encore? Vous m'inquietez: est-ce que vous n'etes pas...
Ahi! ahi! vous m'otez ma couverture.
Sachons de quoi il s'agit.
ARLEQUIN, a part.
Preparons un peu cette affaire-la...
(Haut.) Madame, votre amour est-il d'une constitution bien robuste? soutiendra-t-il bien la fatigue que je vais lui donner? Un mauvais gite lui fait-il peur? Je vais le loger petitement.
Ah! tirez-moi d'inquietude.
En un mot, qui etes-vous? Je suis...
N'avez-vous jamais vu de fausse monnoie? Savez-vous ce que c'est qu'un louis d'or faux? En bien, je ressemble assez a cela.
Achevez donc.
Quel est votre nom? Mon nom! (A part.) Lui dirai-je que je m'appelle Arlequin? Non: cela rime trop avec coquin.
Eh bien? Ah, dame! il y a un peu a tirer ici.
Haissez-vous la qualite de soldat? Qu'appellez-vous un soldat? Oui, par exemple, un soldat d'antichambre.
Un soldat d'antichambre! Ce n'est donc point Dorante a qui je parle enfin? C'est lui qui est mon capitaine.
Faquin! ARLEQUIN, a part.
Je n'ai pu eviter la rime.
Mais voyez ce magot.
tenez! La jolie culbute que je fais la! Il y a une heure que je lui demande grace et que je  m'epuise en humilites pour cet animal-la.
Helas! Madame, si vous preferiez l'amour a la gloire, je vous ferois bien autant de profit qu'un monsieur.
LISETTE, riant.
Ah! ah! ah! je ne saurais pourtant m'empecher d'en rire, avec sa gloire! et il n'y a plus que ce parti-la a prendre...
Va, va, ma gloire te pardonne; elle est de bonne composition.
Tout de bon, charitable dame? Ah! que mon amour vous promet de reconnoissance! Touche-la, Arlequin; je suis prise pour dupe: le soldat d'antichambre de Monsieur vaut bien la coiffeuse de Madame.
La coiffeuse de Madame! C'est mon capitaine, ou l'equivalent.
Masque! Prends ta revanche.
Mais voyez cette magotte, avec qui, depuis une heure, j'entre en confusion de ma misere! Venons au fait.
M'aimes-tu? Pardi, oui: en changeant de nom, tu n'as pas change de visage, et tu sais bien que nous nous sommes promis fidelite en depit de toutes les fautes d'orthographe.
Va, le mal n'est pas grand, consolons-nous; ne faisons semblant de rien, et n'appretons point a rire.
Il y a apparence que ton maitre est encore dans l'erreur a l'egard de ma maitresse: ne l'avertis de rien; laissons les choses comme elles sont.
Je crois que le voici qui entre.
Monsieur, je suis votre servante.
Et moi votre valet, Madame.
(Riant.) Ha! ha! ha! Eh bien, tu quittes la fille d'Orgon: lui as-tu dit qui tu etois? Pardi, oui.
La pauvre enfant! j'ai trouve son coeur plus doux qu'un agneau: il n'a pas souffle.
Quand je lui ai dit que je m'appellois Arlequin et que j'avois un habit d'ordonnance: "Eh bien, mon ami, m'a-t-elle dit, chacun a son nom dans la vie, chacun a son habit; le votre ne vous coute rien." Cela ne laisse pas d'etre gracieux.
Quelle sort d'histoire me contes-tu la? Tant y a que je vais la demander en mariage.
Comment? elle consent a t'epouser? La voila bien malade! Tu m'en imposes: elle ne sait pas qui tu es.
Tu es un fourbe.
Cela n'est pas concevable, et je vois bien qu'il faudra que j'avertisse monsieur Orgon.
Qui, notre pere? Ah! le bon homme! nous l'avons dans notre manche.
C'est le meilleur humain, la meilleure pate d'homme...
Vous m'en direz des nouvelles.
Quel extravagant! As-tu vu Lisette? Lisette! non: peut-etre a-t-elle passe devant mes yeux; mais un honnete homme ne prend pas garde a une chambriere: je vous cede ma part de cette attention-la.
Va-t-en, la tete te tourne.
Vos petites manieres sont un peu aisees; mais c'est la grande habitude qui fait cela.
Quand j'aurai epouse, nous vivrons but a but.
Votre soubrette arrive.
Bonjour, Lisette; je vous recommande Bourguignon: c'est un garcon qui a quelque merite.
DORANTE, a part.
Qu'elle est digne d'etre aimee! Pourquoi faut-il que Mario m'ait prevenu? Ou etiez-vous donc, Monsieur? Depuis que j'ai quitte  Mario, je n'ai pu vous retrouver pour vous rendre compte de ce que j'ai dit a monsieur Orgon.
Je ne me suis pourtant pas eloigne.
Mais de quoi s'agit-il? SILVIA, a part.
Quelle froideur! (Haut.) J'ai eu beau decrier votre valet et prendre sa conscience a temoin de son peu de merite, j'ai eu beau lui representer qu'on pouvoit du moins reculer le mariage, il ne m'a pas seulement ecoutee.
Je vous avertis meme qu'on parle d'envoyer chez le notaire, et qu'il est temps de vous declarer.
C'est mon intention, je vais partir incognito, et je laisserai un billet qui instruira monsieur Orgon de tout.
SILVIA, a part.
Partir! ce n'est pas la mon compte.
N'approuvez-vous pas mon idee? Mais ...
pas trop.
Je ne vois pourtant rien de mieux dans la situation ou je suis, a moins que de parler moi-meme: et je ne saurois m'y resoudre.
J'ai d'ailleurs d'autres raisons qui veulent que je me retire; je n'ai plus que faire ici.
Comme je ne sais pas vos raisons, je ne puis ni les approuver ni les combattre, et ce n'est pas a moi a vous les demander.
Il vous est aise de les soupconner, Lisette.
Mais je pense, par exemple, que vous avez du gout pour la fille de monsieur Orgon.
Ne voyez-vous que cela? Il y a bien encore certaines choses que je pourrais supposer;  mais je ne suis pas folle, et je n'ai pas la vanite de m'y arreter.
Ni le courage d'en parler, car vous n'auriez rien d'obligeant a me dire.
Adieu, Lisette.
Prenez garde: je crois que vous ne m'entendez pas, je suis obligee de vous le dire.
A merveille, et l'explication ne me seroit pas favorable.
Gardez-moi le secret jusqu'a mon depart.
Quoi! serieusement, vous partez? Vous avez bien peur que je ne change d'avis.
Que vous etes aimable d'etre si bien au fait! Cela est bien naif.
(Il s'en va.) SILVIA, a part.
S'il part, je ne l'aime plus, je ne l'epouserai jamais...
(Elle le regarde aller.) Il s'arrete pourtant: il reve, il regarde si je tourne la tete.
Je ne saurais le rappeler, moi...
Il seroit pourtant singulier qu'il partit, apres tout ce que j'ai fait!...
Ah! voila qui est fini: il s'en va; je n'ai pas tant de pouvoir sur lui que je le croyois.
Mon frere est un maladroit, il s'y est mal pris: les gens indifferents gatent tout.
Ne suis-je pas bien avancee? Quel denouement!...
Dorante reparoit pourtant; il me semble qu'il revient; je me dedis donc, je l'aime encore...
Feignons de sortir, afin qu'il m'arrete: il faut bien que notre reconciliation lui coute quelque chose.
DORANTE, l'arretant.
Restez, je vous prie; j'ai encore quelque chose a vous dire.
A moi, Monsieur? J'ai de la peine a partir sans vous avoir convaincue que je n'ai pas tort de le faire.
Eh! Monsieur, de quelle consequence est-il de vous justifier aupres de moi? Ce n'est pas la peine: je ne suis qu'une suivante, et vous me le faites bien sentir.
Moi, Lisette? Est-ce a vous a vous plaindre, vous qui me voyez prendre mon parti sans me rien dire? Hum! si je voulois, je vous repondrois bien la-dessus.
Repondez donc: je ne demande pas mieux que de me tromper.
Mais que dis-je? Mario vous aime.
Cela est vrai.
Vous etes sensible a son amour, je l'ai vu par l'extreme envie que vous aviez tantot que je m'en allasse: ainsi vous ne sauriez m'aimer.
Je suis sensible a son amour! qui est-ce qui vous l'a dit? Je ne saurois vous aimer! qu'en savez-vous? Vous decidez bien vite.
Eh bien, Lisette, par tout ce que vous avez de plus cher au monde, instruisez-moi de ce qui en est, je vous en conjure.
Instruire un homme qui part! Je ne partirai point.
Tenez, si vous m'aimez, ne m'interrogez point: vous ne craignez que mon indifference, et vous etes trop heureux que je me taise.
Vous m'aimez; mais votre amour n'est pas une chose bien serieuse pour vous.
Vous en rirez peut-etre au sortir d'ici, et vous aurez raison.
Moi qui vous parle, je me ferois un scrupule de vous dire que je vous aime dans les dispositions ou vous etes: l'aveu de mes sentiments pourrait exposer votre raison; et vous voyez bien aussi que je vous les cache.
Ah! ma chere Lisette, que viens-je d'entendre! Tes  paroles ont un feu qui me penetre; je t'adore, je te respecte.
Il n'est ni rang, ni naissance, ni fortune, qui ne disparoisse devant une ame comme la tienne; j'aurois honte que mon orgueil tint encore contre toi, et mon coeur et ma main t'appartiennent.
Vos menaces ne me font point de peur.
Oh! je n'y tacherai point; gardez-la, nous verrons ce que vous en ferez.
Ne consentez-vous pas d'etre a moi? Quoi! vous m'epouserez malgre ce que vous etes, malgre la colere d'un pere, malgre votre fortune? Mon pere me pardonnera des qu'il vous aura vue: ma fortune nous suffit a tous deux, et le merite vaut bien la naissance.
Ne disputons point, car je ne changerai jamais.
Il ne changera jamais! Savez-vous bien que vous me charmez, Dorante.
Ne genez donc plus votre tendresse, et laissez-la repondre...
Enfin, j'en suis venu a bout: vous...
vous ne changerez jamais? Non, ma chere Lisette.
Que d'amour! Ah! mon pere, vous avez voulu que je fusse a Dorante: venez voir votre fille vous obeir avec plus de joie qu'on n'en eut jamais.
Qu'entends-je! vous, son pere, Monsieur? Oui, Dorante.
La meme idee de nous connoitre nous est venue a tous deux; apres cela, je n'ai plus rien a vous dire.
Vous m'aimez, je n'en saurais douter; mais, a votre tour, jugez de mes sentiments pour vous; jugez du cas que j'ai fait de votre coeur par la delicatesse avec laquelle j'ai tache de l'acquerir.
Connoissez-vous cette lettre-la? Voila par ou j'ai appris votre deguisement, qu'elle n'a pourtant su que par vous.
Je ne saurais vous exprimer mon bonheur, Madame; mais ce qui m'enchante le plus, ce sont les preuves que je vous ai donnees de ma tendresse.
Dorante me pardonne-t-il la colere ou j'ai mis Bourguignon? Il ne vous la pardonne pas, il vous en remercie.
De la joie, Madame: vous avez perdu votre rang; mais vous n'etes point a plaindre, puisqu'Arlequin vous reste.
Belle consolation! il n'y a que toi qui gagne a cela.
Je n'y perds pas.
Avant notre reconnoissance, votre dot valoit mieux que vous; a present, vous valez mieux que votre dot.
Allons, saute, marquis! LISETTE, suivante de la Comtesse.
LEPINE, valet de chambre du Marquis.
La demarche que vous allez faire aupres du Marquis m'alarme.
Je ne risque rien, vous dis-je.
Defunt son parent et le mien lui laisse six cent mille francs, a la charge, il est vrai, de m'epouser ou de m'en donner deux cent mille: cela est a son choix; mais le Marquis ne sent rien pour moi.
Mais a quoi jugez-vous que la Comtesse ne le hait pas? A mille petites remarques que je fais tous les jours, et je n'en suis pas surprise.
Du caractere dont elle est, celui du Marquis doit etre de son gout.
La Comtesse est une femme brusque, qui aime a primer, a gouverner, a etre la maitresse.
Le Marquis est un homme doux, paisible, aise a conduire; et voila ce qu'il faut a la Comtesse.
Aussi ne parle-t-elle de lui qu'avec eloge.
Son air de naivete lui plait: c'est, dit-elle, le meilleur homme, le plus complaisant, le plus sociable.
D'ailleurs, le Marquis est d'un age qui lui convient; elle n'est plus de cette grande jeunesse: il a trente-cinq ou quarante ans, et je vois bien qu'elle seroit charmee de vivre avec lui.
J'ai peur que l'evenement ne vous trompe.
Oh! moyennant l'embarras ou je vais jeter le Marquis, il faudra bien qu'il parle; et je veux savoir a quoi m'en tenir.
Depuis le temps que nous sommes a cette campagne, chez la Comtesse, il ne me dit rien.
Il y a six semaines qu'il se tait; je veux qu'il s'explique.
Je ne perdrai pas le legs qui me revient si je n'epouse point le Marquis.
Mais s'il accepte votre main? Eh! non! vous dis-je.
Laissez-moi faire.
Je crois qu'il espere que ce sera moi qui le refuserai.
Peut-etre meme feindra-t-il de consentir a notre union; mais que cela ne vous epouvante pas.
Vous n'etes point assez riche pour m'epouser avec deux cent mille francs de moins: je suis bien aise de vous les apporter en mariage.
Je suis persuadee que la Comtesse et le Marquis ne se haissent pas.
Voyons ce que me diront la-dessus Lepine et Lisette, qui vont venir me parler.
L'un, est un Gascon froid, mais adroit; Lisette a de l'esprit.
Je sais qu'ils ont tous deux la confiance de leurs maitres; je les interesserai a m'instruire, et tout ira bien.
Les voila qui viennent.
Venez, Lisette; approchez.
Que souhaitez-vous de nous, Madame? Rien que vous ne puissiez me dire sans blesser la fidelite que vous devez, vous au Marquis, et vous a la Comtesse.
Tant mieux, Madame.
Ce debut encourage.
Nos services vous sont acquis.
HORTENSE, tire quelque argent de sa poche.
Tenez, Lisette, tout service merite recompense.
LISETTE, refusant d'abord.
Du moins, Madame, faudroit-il savoir auparavant de quoi il s'agit.
Prenez; je vous le donne, quoi qu'il arrive.
Voila pour vous, monsieur de Lepine.
Madame, je serois volontiers de l'avis de Mademoiselle; mais je prends.
Le respect defend que je raisonne.
Je ne pretends vous engager en rien, et voici de quoi il est question.
Le Marquis, votre maitre, vous estime, Lepine? LEPINE, froidement.
Extremement, Madame; il me connoit.
Je remarque qu'il vous confie aisement ce qu'il pense.
Madame, de toutes ses pensees incontinent j'en ai copie; il n'en sait pas le compte mieux que moi.
Vous, Lisette, vous etes sur le meme ton avec la Comtesse? J'ai cet honneur-la, Madame.
Dites-moi, Lepine, je me figure que le Marquis aime la  Comtesse.
Me trompe-je? Il n'y a point d'inconvenient a me dire ce qui en est.
Je n'affirme rien; mais patience: nous devons ce soir nous entretenir la-dessus.
Eh! soupconnez-vous qu'il l'aime? De soupcons, j'en ai de violents.
Je m'en eclaircirai tantot.
Et vous, Lisette, quel est votre sentiment sur la Comtesse? Qu'elle ne songe point du tout au Marquis, Madame.
Je differe avec vous de pensee.
Je crois aussi qu'ils s'aiment.
Et supposons que je ne me trompe pas: du caractere dont ils sont, ils auront de la peine a s'en parler.
Vous, Lepine, voudriez-vous exciter le Marquis a le declarer a la Comtesse? Et vous, Lisette, disposer la Comtesse a se l'entendre dire? Ce sera une industrie fort innocente.
Et meme louable.
LISETTE, rendant l'argent.
Madame, permettez que je vous rende votre argent.
D'ou vient? C'est qu'il me semble que voila, precisement le service que vous exigez de moi, et c'est precisement celui que je ne puis vous rendre.
Ma maitresse est veuve, elle est tranquille; son etat est heureux; ce seroit dommage de l'en tirer: je prie le Ciel qu'elle y reste.
LEPINE, froidement.
Quant a moi, je garde mon lot: rien ne m'oblige a restitution.
J'ai la volonte de vous etre utile.
Monsieur le Marquis vit dans le celibat; mais le mariage, il est bon, tres bon; il a ses peines: chaque etat a les siennes; quelquefois le mien me pese.
Le tout est egal.
Oui, je vous servirai, Madame, je vous servirai; je n'y vois point de mal.
On s'epouse de tout temps, on s'epousera toujours; on n'a que cette honnete ressource quand on aime.
Vous me surprenez, Lisette, d'autant plus que je m'imaginois que vous pouviez vous aimer tous deux.
C'est de quoi il n'est pas question de ma part.
De la mienne, j'en suis demeure a l'estime.
Neanmoins, Mademoiselle est aimable; mais j'ai passe mon chemin sans y prendre garde.
J'espere que vous penserez toujours de meme.
Voila ce que j'avois a vous dire.
Adieu, Lisette; vous ferez ce qu'il vous plaira.
Je ne vous demande que le secret.
J'accepte vos services, Lepine.
Nous n'avons rien a nous dire, mons de Lepine.
J'ai affaire, et je vous laisse.
Doucement, Mademoiselle; retardez d'un moment.
Je trouve a propos de vous informer d'un petit accident qui m'arrive.
D'homme d'honneur, je n'avois pas envisage vos graces; je ne connoissois pas votre mine.
Qu'importe? Je vous en offre autant: c'est tout au plus si je connois actuellement la votre.
Cette dame se figuroit que nous nous aimions.
Eh bien! elle se figuroit mal.
Attendez, voici l'accident: son discours a fait que mes yeux se sont arretes dessus vous plus attentivement que de coutume.
Vos yeux ont pris bien de la peine.
Et vous etes jolie, sandis! oh! tres jolie! Ma foi, monsieur de Lepine, vous etes tres galant, oh! tres galant.
Mais l'ennui me prend des qu'on me loue.
Abregeons; est-ce la tout? A mon exemple, envisagez-moi, je vous prie; faites-en l'epreuve.
Oui-da! Tenez, je vous regarde.
Eh donc! Est-ce la ce Lepine que vous connoissiez? N'y voyez-vous rien de nouveau? Que vous dit le coeur? Pas le mot; il n'y a rien la pour lui.
Quelquefois pourtant nombre de gens ont estime que j'etois un garcon assez revenant; mais nous y retournerons: c'est partie a remettre.
Ecoutez le restant.
Il est certain que mon maitre distingue tendrement votre maitresse.
Aujourd'hui meme il m'a confie qu'il meditoit de vous communiquer ses sentiments.
Comme il lui plaira.
La reponse que j'aurai l'honneur de lui communiquer sera courte.
Remarquons d'abondance que la Comtesse se plait avec mon maitre, qu'elle a l'ame joyeuse en le voyant.
Vous me direz que nos gens sont d'etranges personnes, et je vous l'accorde.
Le moyen que l'amour puisse etre mis en avant avec cette femme! Il ne sera jamais a propos de lui dire:  "Je vous aime," a moins qu'on ne lui dise a propos de rien.
Cette matiere, avec elle, ne peut tomber que des nues.
On dit qu'elle traite l'amour de bagatelle d'enfant; moi, je pretends qu'elle a pris gout a cette enfance.
Dans cette conjoncture, j'opine que nous encouragions ces deux personnages.
Qu'en sera-t-il? Qu'ils s'aimeront bonnement, en toute simplesse, et qu'ils s'epouseront de meme.
Qu'en sera-t-il? Qu'en me voyant votre camarade, vous me rendrez votre mari par la douce habitude de me voir.
Eh donc! Parlez: etes-vous d'accord? Non.
Mademoiselle, est-ce mon amour qui vous deplait? Oui.
En peu de mots vous dites beaucoup.
Mais considerez l'occurrence: je vous predis que nos maitres se marieront: que la commodite vous tente.
Je vous predis qu'ils ne se marieront point: je ne veux pas, moi.
Ma maitresse, comme vous dites fort habilement, tient l'amour au-dessous d'elle, et j'aurai soin de l'entretenir dans cette humeur, attendu qu'il n'est pas de mon petit interet qu'elle se marie.
Ma condition n'en seroit pas si bonne, entendez-vous? Il n'y a pas d'apparence que la Comtesse y gagne, et moi j'y perdrais beaucoup.
J'ai fait un petit calcul la-dessus, au moyen duquel je trouve que tous vos arrangements me derangent et ne me valent rien.
Ainsi, quelque jolie que je sois, continuez de n'en rien voir; laissez-la la decouverte que vous avez faite de mes graces, et passez toujours sans y prendre garde.
LEPINE, froidement.
Je les ai vues, Mademoiselle; j'en suis frappe, et n'ai de remede que votre coeur.
Tenez-vous donc pour incurable.
Me donnez-vous votre dernier mot? Je n'y changerai pas une syllabe.
(Elle veut s'en aller.) LEPINE, l'arretant.
Permettez que je reparte.
Vous calculez, moi de meme.
Selon vous, il ne faut pas que nos gens se marient; il faut qu'ils s'epousent, selon moi: je le pretends.
Mauvaise gasconnade! LEPINE.
Je vous aime, et vous me refusez le reciproque? Je calcule qu'il me fait besoin, et je l'aurai, sandis! Je le pretends.
Vous ne l'aurez pas, sandis! J'ai tout dit.
Laissez parler mon maitre, qui nous arrive.
Ah! vous voici, Lisette! Je suis bien aise de vous trouver.
Je vous suis obligee, Monsieur; mais je m'en allois.
Vous vous en alliez? J'avois pourtant quelque chose a vous dire.
Etes-vous un peu de nos amis? Petitement.
J'ai beaucoup d'estime et de respect pour monsieur le Marquis.
Tout de bon? Vous me faites plaisir, Lisette.
Je fais beaucoup de cas de vous aussi; vous me paroissez une tres bonne fille, et vous etes a une maitresse qui a bien du merite.
Il y a longtemps que je le sais, Monsieur.
Ne vous parle-t-elle jamais de moi? Que vous en dit-elle? Oh! rien.
C'est que, entre nous, il n'y a point de femme que j'aime tant qu'elle.
Qu'appelez-vous aimer, monsieur le Marquis? Est-ce de l'amour que vous entendez? Eh! mais oui, de l'amour, de l'inclination, comme tu voudras: le nom n'y fait rien.
Je l'aime mieux qu'une autre.
Voila tout.
Cela se peut.
Mais elle n'en sait rien; je n'ai pas ose le lui apprendre.
Je n'ai pas trop le talent de parler d'amour.
C'est ce qui me semble.
Oui, cela m'embarrasse; et, comme ta maitresse est une femme fort raisonnable, j'ai peur qu'elle ne se moque de moi, et je ne saurois plus que lui dire: de sorte que j'ai reve qu'il seroit bon que tu la previnsses en ma faveur.
Je vous demande pardon, Monsieur; mais il falloit rever tout le contraire.
Je ne puis rien pour vous, en verite.
Eh! d'ou vient? Je t'aurai grande obligation.
Je payerai bien tes peines.
(Montrant Lepine.) Et, si ce garcon-la te convenoit, je vous ferois un fort bon parti a tous les deux.
LEPINE, froidement, et sans regarder Lisette.
Derechef, recueillez-vous la-dessus, Mademoiselle.
Il n'y a pas moyen, monsieur le Marquis.
Si je parlois de vos sentiments a ma maitresse, vous avez beau dire que le nom n'y fait rien, je me brouillerais avec elle; je vous y brouillerais vous-meme.
Ne la connoissez-vous pas? Tu crois donc qu'il n'y a rien a faire? Absolument rien.
Tant pis.
Cela me chagrine.
Elle me fait tant d'amitie, cette femme! Allons, il ne faut donc plus y penser.
LEPINE, froidement.
Monsieur, ne vous deconfortez pas.
Du recit de Mademoiselle, n'en tenez compte; elle vous triche.
Venez me consulter a l'ecart; je serai plus consolant.
Voyons ce que tu as a me dire.
Adieu, Lisette.
Ne me nuis pas, voila tout ce que j'exige.
N'exigez rien: ne genons point Mademoiselle.
Soyons galamment ennemis declares; faisons-nous du mal en toute franchise.
Adieu, gentille personne.
Je vous cheris ni plus ni moins: gardez-moi votre coeur: c'est un depot que je vous laisse.
Adieu, mon pauvre Lepine.
Vous etes peut-etre de tous les fous de la Garonne le plus effronte, mais aussi le plus divertissant.
Voici ma maitresse.
De l'humeur dont elle est, je crois que cet amour-ci ne la divertira guere.
Gare que le Marquis ne soit bientot congedie! LA COMTESSE, tenant une lettre.
Tenez, Lisette, dites qu'on porte cette lettre a la poste.
En voila dix que j'ecris depuis trois semaines.
La sotte chose qu'un proces! Que j'en suis lasse! Je ne m'etonne pas s'il y a tant de femmes qui se marient! LISETTE, riant.
Bon! votre proces! une affaire de mille francs! Voila quelque chose de bien considerable pour vous! Avez-vous envie de vous remarier? J'ai votre affaire.
Qu'est-ce que c'est qu'envie de me remarier? Pourquoi me dites-vous cela? Ne vous fachez pas; je ne veux que vous divertir.
Ce pourrait etre quelqu'un de Paris qui vous auroit fait une confidence.
En tout cas, ne me le nommez pas.
Oh! il faut pourtant que vous connoissiez celui dont je parle.
Brisons la-dessus.
Je reve a une chose: le Marquis n'a ici qu'un valet de chambre, dont il a peut-etre besoin, et je voulois lui demander s'il n'a pas quelque paquet a mettre a la poste: on le porteroit avec le mien.
Ou est-il, le Marquis? L'as-tu vu ce matin? Oh! oui.
Malepeste! il a ses raisons pour etre eveille de bonne heure! Revenons au mari que j'ai a vous donner, celui qui brule pour vous et que vous avez enflamme de passion...
Qui est ce benet-la? Vous le devinez.
Celui qui brule est un sot.
Je ne veux rien savoir de Paris.
Ce n'est point de Paris: votre conquete est dans le chateau.
Vous l'appellez benet; moi, je vais le flatter: c'est un soupirant qui a l'air fort simple, un air de bon homme.
Y etes-vous? Nullement.
Qui est-ce qui ressemble a celui-ci? Eh! le Marquis.
Celui qui est avec nous? Lui-meme.
Je n'avois garde d'y etre.
Ou as-tu pris son air simple et de bon homme? Dis donc un air franc et ouvert, a la bonne heure: il sera reconnoissable.
Ma foi, Madame, je vous le rends comme je le vois.
Tu le vois tres mal, on ne peut pas plus mal: en mille ans on ne le devineroit pas a ce portrait-la.
Mais de qui tiens-tu ce que tu me contes de son amour? De lui, qui me l'a dit; rien que cela.
N'en riez-vous pas? Ne faites pas semblant de le savoir.
Au reste, il n'y a qu'a vous en defaire tout doucement.
Helas! je ne lui en veux point de mal.
C'est un fort honnete homme, un homme dont je fais cas, qui a d'excellentes qualites; et j'aime encore mieux que ce soit lui qu'un autre.
Mais ne te trompes-tu pas aussi? Il ne t'aura peut-etre parle que d'estime: il en a beaucoup pour moi, beaucoup; il me l'a marquee en mille occasions d'une maniere fort obligeante.
Non, Madame, c'est de l'amour qui regarde vos appas; il en a prononce le mot sans bredouiller comme a l'ordinaire.
C'est de la flamme...
Il languit, il soupire.
Est-il possible? Sur ce pied-la, je le plains, car ce n'est pas un etourdi: il faut qu'il le sente, puisqu'il le dit; et ce n'est pas de ces gens-la dont je me moque: jamais leur amour n'est ridicule.
Mais il n'osera m'en parler, n'est-ce pas? Oh! ne craignez rien! j'y ai mis bon ordre: il ne s'y jouera pas.
Je lui ai ote toute esperance.
N'ai-je pas bien fait? Mais oui, sans doute, oui, pourvu que vous ne l'ayez pas brusque, pourtant.
Il falloit y prendre garde: c'est un ami que je veux conserver.
Et vous avez quelquefois le ton dur et reveche, Lisette; il valoit mieux le laisser dire.
Point du tout.
Il vouloit que je vous parlasse en sa faveur.
Ce pauvre homme! Et je lui ai repondu que je ne pouvois pas m'en meler, que je me brouillerais avec vous si je vous en parlois, que vous me donneriez mon conge, que vous lui donneriez le sien.
Le sien.
Quelle grossierete! Ah! que c'est mal parler! Son conge? Et meme est-ce que je vous aurois donne le votre? Vous savez bien que non.
D'ou vient mentir, Lisette? C'est un ennemi que vous m'allez faire d'un des hommes du monde que je considere le plus et qui le merite le mieux.
Quel sot langage de domestique! Eh! il etoit si simple de vous tenir a lui dire: "Monsieur, je ne saurois; ce ne sont pas la mes affaires.
Parlez-en vous-meme." Et je voudrais qu'il osat m'en parler, pour racommoder un peu votre malhonnetete.
Son conge! son conge! Il va se croire insulte.
Eh non, Madame; il etoit impossible de vous en debarrasser a moins de frais.
Faut-il que vous l'aimiez, de peur de le facher? Voulez-vous etre sa femme par politesse, lui qui doit epouser Hortense? Je ne lui ai rien dit de trop; et vous en voila quitte.
Mais je l'apercois qui vient en revant.
Evitez-le, vous avez le temps.
L'eviter, lui qui me voit! Ah! je m'en garderai bien.
Apres les discours que vous lui avez tenus, il croirait que je les ai dictes.
Non, non, je ne changerai rien a ma facon de vivre avec lui.
Allez porter ma lettre.
LISETTE, a part.
Hum! il y a ici quelque chose.
(Haut.) Madame, je suis d'avis de rester aupres de vous.
Cela m'arrive souvent, et vous en serez plus a l'abri d'une declaration.
Belle finesse! Quand je lui echapperois aujourd'hui, ne me trouvera-t-il pas demain? Il faudrait donc vous avoir toujours a mes cotes? Non, non.
S'il me parle, je sais repondre.
Je suis a vous dans l'instant; je n'ai qu'a donner cette lettre a un laquais.
Non, Lisette: c'est une lettre de consequence, et vous me ferez plaisir de la porter vous-meme, parce que, si le courier est passe, vous me la rapporterez, et je l'enverrai par une autre voie.
Je ne me fie point aux valets: ils ne sont point exacts.
Le courrier ne passe que dans deux heures, Madame.
Eh! allez, vous dis-je.
Que sait-on? LISETTE, a part.
Quel pretexte! (Haut.) Cette femme-la ne va pas droit avec moi.
LA COMTESSE, seule.
Elle avoit la fureur de rester.
Les domestiques sont haissables; il n'y a pas jusqu'a leur zele qui ne vous desoblige.
C'est toujours de travers qu'ils vous servent.
Madame, monsieur le Marquis vous a vue de loin avec Lisette.
Il demande s'il n'y a point de mal qu'il approche; il a le desir de vous consulter, mais il se fait le scrupule de vous etre importun.
Lui importun! Il ne sauroit l'etre.
Dites-lui que je l'attends, Lepine; qu'il vienne.
Je vais le rejouir de la nouvelle.
Vous l'allez voir dans la minute.
LEPINE, appelant le Marquis.
Monsieur, venez prendre audience.
Madame l'accorde.
(Quand le Marquis est venu, il lui dit a part:) Courage, Monsieur! l'accueil est gracieux, presque tendre: c'est un coeur qui demande qu'on le prenne.
Eh! d'ou vient donc la ceremonie que vous faites, Marquis?...
Vous n'y songez pas.
Madame, vous avez bien de la bonte...
C'est que j'ai bien des choses a vous dire.
Effectivement, vous me paroissez reveur, inquiet.
Oui, j'ai l'esprit en peine.
J'ai besoin de conseil, j'ai besoin de graces, et le tout de votre part.
Tant mieux.
Vous avez encore moins besoin de tout cela que je n'ai d'envie de vous etre bonne a quelque chose.
O bonne! Il ne tient qu'a vous de m'etre excellente, si vous voulez.
Comment, si je veux? Manquez-vous de confiance? Ah! je vous prie, ne me menagez point.
Vous pouvez tout sur moi, Marquis; je suis bien aise de vous le dire.
Cette assurance m'est bien agreable, et je serois tente d'en abuser.
J'ai grand'peur que vous ne resistiez a la tentation.
Vous ne comptez pas assez sur vos amis, car vous etes si reserve, si retenu...
Oui, j'ai beaucoup de timidite.
Je fais de mon mieux pour vous l'oter, comme vous voyez.
Vous savez dans quelle situation je suis avec Hortense; que je dois l'epouser ou lui donner deux cent mille francs.
Oui, et je me suis apercue que vous n'aviez pas grand gout pour elle.
Oh! on ne peut pas moins.
Je ne l'aime point du tout.
Je n'en suis pas surprise: son caractere est si different du votre! Elle a quelque chose de trop arrange pour vous.
Vous y etes.
Elle songe trop a ses graces.
Il faudroit toujours l'entretenir de compliments, et moi, ce n'est pas la mon fort.
La coquetterie me gene, elle me rend muet.
Ah! ah! je conviens qu'elle en a un peu; mais presque toutes les femmes sont de meme.
Vous ne trouverez que cela partout, Marquis.
Hors chez vous.
Quelle difference, par exemple! Vous plaisez sans y penser.
Ce n'est pas votre faute: vous ne savez pas seulement que vous etes aimable; mais d'autres le savent pour vous.
Moi, Marquis, je pense qu'a cet egard-la les autres songent aussi peu a moi que j'y songe moi-meme.
Oh! j'en connois qui ne vous disent pas tout ce qu'ils songent.
Eh! qui sont-ils, Marquis? Quelques amis comme vous, sans doute.
Bon, des amis! Voila bien de quoi! Vous n'en aurez encore de longtemps.
Je vous suis obligee du petit compliment que vous me faites en passant.
Point du tout.
Je ne passe jamais, moi; je dis toujours expres.
LA COMTESSE, riant.
Comment! vous qui ne voulez pas que j'aie encore des amis, est-ce que vous n'etes pas le mien? Vous m'excuserez; mais, quand je serois autre chose, il n'y auroit rien de surprenant.
Eh bien! je ne laisserois pas que d'en etre surprise.
Et encore plus fachee.
En verite, surprise.
Je veux pourtant croire que je suis aimable, puisque vous le dites.
O charmante! Et je serois bien heureux si Hortense vous ressembloit.
Je l'epouserois d'un grand coeur, et j'ai bien de la peine a m'y resoudre.
Je le crois, et ce seroit encore pis si vous aviez de l'inclination pour une autre.
Eh bien! c'est que justement le pis s'y trouve.
LA COMTESSE, par exclamation.
Oui? Vous aimez ailleurs? De toute mon ame.
LA COMTESSE, en souriant.
Je m'en suis doutee, Marquis.
Et vous etes-vous doutee de la personne? Non, mais vous me la direz.
Vous me feriez grand plaisir de la deviner.
Eh! pourquoi m'en donneriez-vous la peine, puisque vous voila? C'est que vous ne connoissez qu'elle: c'est la plus aimable femme, la plus franche.
Vous parlez de gens sans facon: il n'y a personne comme elle; plus je la vois, plus je l'admire.
Epousez-la, Marquis, epousez-la, et laissez la Hortense.
Il n'y a point a hesiter: vous n'avez point d'autre parti a prendre.
Oui, mais je songe a une chose...
N'y auroit-il pas moyen de me sauver les deux cent mille francs? Je vous parle a coeur ouvert.
Regardez-moi dans cette occasion-ci comme une autre vous-meme.
Ah! que c'est bien dit! une autre moi-meme! Ce qui me plait en vous, c'est votre franchise, qui est une qualite admirable.
Comment vous sauver ces deux cent mille francs? C'est que Hortense aime le Chevalier.
Mais, a propos, c'est votre parent? Oh! parent de loin.
Or, de cet amour qu'elle a pour lui, je conclus qu'elle ne se soucie pas de moi.
Je n'ai donc qu'a faire semblant de vouloir l'epouser.
Elle me refusera, et je ne lui devrai plus rien.
Son refus me servira de quittance.
Oui-da, vous pouvez le tenter.
Ce n'est pas qu'il n'y ait du risque: elle a du discernement, Marquis, Vous supposez qu'elle vous refusera; je n'en sais rien: vous n'etes pas homme a dedaigner.
Est-il vrai? C'est mon sentiment.
Vous me flattez; vous encouragez ma franchise.
Je vous encourage! Eh! mais en etes-vous encore la? Mettez-vous donc dans l'esprit que je ne demande qu'a vous obliger, qu'il n'y a que l'impossible qui m'arretera, et que vous devez compter sur tout ce qui dependra de moi.
Ne perdez point cela de vue, etrange homme que vous etes, et achevez hardiment.
Vous voulez des conseils, je vous en donne.
Quand nous en serons a l'article des graces, il n'y aura qu'a parler: elles ne feront pas plus de difficulte que le reste, entendez-vous? Et que cela soit dit pour toujours.
Vous me ravissez d'esperance.
Allons par ordre.
Si Hortense alloit vous prendre au mot? J'espere que non.
En tout cas, je lui payerais sa somme, pourvu qu'auparavant la personne qui a pris mon coeur ait la bonte de me dire qu'elle veut bien de moi.
Helas! elle serait donc bien difficile? Mais, Marquis, est-ce qu'elle ne sait pas que vous l'aimez? Non, vraiment; je n'ai pas ose le lui dire.
Et le tout par timidite.
Oh! en verite, c'est la pousser trop loin; et, toute amie des bienseances que je suis, je ne vous approuve pas; ce n'est pas se rendre justice.
LE MARQUfS.
Elle est si sensee que j'ai peur d'elle.
Vous me conseillez donc de lui en parler? Eh! cela devroit etre fait.
Peut-etre vous attend-elle.
Vous dites qu'elle est sensee: que craignez-vous? Il est louable de penser modestement sur soi; mais, avec de la modestie, on parle, on se propose.
Parlez, Marquis, parlez: tout ira bien.
Helas! si vous saviez qui c'est, vous ne m'exhorteriez pas tant.
Que vous etes heureuse de n'aimer rien et de mepriser l'amour! Moi, mepriser ce qu'il y a au monde de plus naturel! Cela ne seroit pas raisonnable.
Ce n'est pas l'amour, ce sont les amants, tels qu'ils sont la plupart, que je meprise, et non pas le sentiment qui fait qu'on aime, qui n'a rien en soi que de fort honnete, de fort permis et de fort involontaire.
C'est le plus doux sentiment de la vie: comment le hairois- je? Non, certes, et il y a tel homme a qui je pardonnerois de m'aimer s'il me l'avouoit avec cette simplicite de caractere que je louois tout a l'heure en vous.
En effet, quand on le dit naivement comme on le sent...
Il n'y a point de mal alors.
On a toujours bonne grace: voila ce que je pense.
Je ne suis pas une ame sauvage.
Ce seroit bien dommage.
Vous avez la plus belle sante.
LA COMTESSE, a part.
Il est bien question de ma sante.
(Haut.) C'est l'air de la campagne.
L'air de la ville vous fait de meme l'oeil le plus vif, le teint le plus frais! Je me porte assez bien.
Mais savez-vous bien que vous me dites des douceurs sans y penser? Pourquoi sans y penser? Moi, j'y pense.
Gardez-les pour la personne que vous aimez.
Eh! si c'etoit vous, il n'y auroit que faire de les garder.
Comment! si c'etoit moi? Est-ce de moi dont il s'agit? Est-ce une declaration d'amour que vous me faites? Oh! point du tout.
Eh! de quoi vous avisez-vous donc de m'entretenir de mon teint, de ma sante? Qui est-ce qui ne s'y tromperoit pas? Ce n'est que facon de parler.
Je dis seulement qu'il est facheux que vous ne vouliez ni aimer, ni vous remarier, et que j'en suis mortifie, parce que je ne vois pas de femme qui me puisse convenir autant que vous.
Mais je ne vous en dis mot, de peur de vous deplaire.
Mais, encore une fois, vous me parlez d'amour.
Je ne me trompe pas, c'est moi que vous aimez: vous me le dites en termes expres.
He bien, oui.
Quand ce seroit vous, il n'est pas necessaire de se facher.
Ne diroit-on pas que tout est perdu? Calmez-vous.
Prenez que je n'aie rien dit.
La belle chute! Vous etes bien singulier.
Et vous de bien mauvaise humeur.
Eh! tout a l'heure, a votre avis, on avoit si bonne grace a dire naivement qu'on aime! Voyez comme cela reussit! Me voila bien avance! Ne le voila-t-il pas bien recule? A qui en avez-vous? Je vous demande a qui vous parlez.
A personne, Madame.
Je ne dirai plus mot.
Etes-vous contente? Si vous vous mettez en colere contre tous ceux qui me ressemblent, vous en querellerez bien d'autres.
LA COMTESSE, a part.
Quel original! (Haut.) Eh! qui est-ce qui vous querelle? Ah! la maniere dont vous me refusez n'est pas douce.
Allez, vous revez.
Avec la qualite d'original dont vous venez de m'honorer tout bas, il ne me manquoit plus que celle de reveur.
Au surplus, je ne m'en plains pas.
Je ne vous conviens point: qu'y faire? Il n'y a plus qu'a me taire, et je me tairai.
Adieu, Comtesse; n'en soyons pas moins bons amis, et du moins ayez la bonte de m'aider a me tirer d'affaire avec Hortense.
(Il s'en va.) Quel homme! Celui-ci ne m'ennuiera pas du recit de mes rigueurs.
J'aime les gens simples et unis; mais, en verite, celui-la l'est trop.
HORTENSE, arretant le Marquis pret a sortir.
Monsieur le Marquis, je vous prie, ne vous en allez pas; nous avons a nous parler, et Madame peut etre presente.
Comme vous voudrez.
Vous savez ce dont il s'agit? Non, je ne sais pas ce que c'est; je ne m'en souviens plus.
Vous me surprenez! Je me flattois que vous seriez le premier a rompre le silence.
Il est humiliant pour moi d'etre obligee de vous prevenir.
Avez- vous oublie qu'il y a un testament qui nous regarde? Oh! oui, je me souviens du testament.
Et qui dispose de ma main en votre faveur? Oui, Madame, oui, il faut que je vous epouse.
Cela est vrai.
He bien, Monsieur, a quoi vous determinez-vous? Il est temps de fixer mon etat.
C'est ce que je lui ai dit jusqu'ici, et, comme il m'assure avoir des raisons pressantes de savoir aujourd'hui meme a quoi s'en tenir, je n'ai pu lui refuser de vous parler.
Monsieur, le congedierai-je, ou non? Que voulez-vous que je lui dise? Ma main est a vous, si vous la demandez.
Vous me faites bien de la grace...
Je la prends, Mademoiselle.
Est-ce votre coeur qui me choisit, monsieur le Marquis? N'etes-vous pas assez aimable pour cela? Et vous m'aimez? Qui est-ce qui dit le contraire? Tout a l'heure j'en parlois a Madame.
Il est vrai, c'etoit de vous dont il m'entretenoit; il songeoit a vous proposer ce mariage.
Et vous disoit-il aussi qu'il m'aimoit? Il me semble qu'oui; du moins me parloit-il de penchant.
D'ou vient donc, monsieur le Marquis, me l'avez-vous laisse ignorer depuis six semaines? Quand on aime, on en donne quelques marques; et, dans le cas ou nous sommes, vous aviez droit de vous declarer.
J'en conviens; mais le temps se passe: on est distrait, on ne sait pas si les gens sont de votre avis.
Vous etes bien modeste.
Voila qui est donc arrete, et je vais l'annoncer au Chevalier, qui entre.
HORTENSE, allant au-devant du Chevalier pour lui  dire un mot a part.
Il accepte ma main, mais de mauvaise grace.
Ce n'est qu'une ruse: ne vous effrayez pas.
LE CHEVALIER, a part.
Vous m'inquietez.
(Haut.) Eh bien, Madame, il ne me reste plus d'esperance, sans doute? Je n'ai pas du m'attendre que monsieur le Marquis put consentir a vous perdre.
Oui, Chevalier, je l'epouse; la chose est conclue, et le Ciel vous destine a une autre qu'a moi.
Le Marquis m'aimoit en secret, et c'etoit, dit-il, par distraction qu'il ne me le declaroit pas...
par distraction.
J'entends, il avoit oublie de vous le dire.
Oui, c'est cela meme; mais il vient de me l'avouer, et il l'avoit confie a Madame.
Eh! que ne m'avertissiez-vous, Comtesse? J'ai cru quelquefois qu'il vous aimoit vous-meme.
Quelle imagination! A propos de quoi me citer ici? Il y a eu des instants ou je le soupconnois aussi.
Encore! Ou est donc la plaisanterie, Hortense? Pour moi, je ne dis mot.
Vous me desesperez, Marquis.
J'en suis fache; mais mettez-vous a ma place: il y a un testament, vous le savez bien, je ne peux pas faire autrement.
Sans le testament, vous n'aimeriez peut-etre pas autant que moi.
Oh! vous me pardonnerez, je n'aime que trop.
Je tacherai de le meriter, Monsieur.
(A part, au Chevalier.) Demandez qu'on presse notre mariage.
LE CHEVALIER, a part, a Hortense.
N'est-ce pas trop risquer? (Haut.) Dans l'etat ou je suis, Marquis, achevez de me prouver que mon malheur est sans remede.
La preuve s'en verra quand je l'epouserai.
Je ne peux pas l'epouser tout a l'heure.
LE CHEVALIER, d'un air inquiet.
Vous avez raison.
(A part, a Hortense.) Il vous epousera.
HORTENSE, a part.
Vous gatez tout.
(Au Marquis.) J'entends bien ce que le Chevalier veut dire: c'est qu'il espere toujours que nous ne nous marierons pas, monsieur le Marquis.
N'est-ce pas, Chevalier? Non, Madame, je n'espere plus rien.
Vous m'excuserez, je le vois bien.
Vous n'etes pas convaincu, vous ne l'etes pas; et, comme il faut, m'avez-vous dit, que vous alliez demain a Paris pour y prendre des mesures, necessaires en cette occasion-ci, vous voudriez, avant que de partir, savoir bien precisement s'il ne nous reste plus d'espoir.
Voila ce que c'est: vous avez besoin d'une entiere certitude.
(A part, au Chevalier.) Dites qu'oui.
Mais oui.
Monsieur le Marquis, nous ne sommes qu'a une lieue de Paris, il est de bonne heure: envoyez Lepine chercher un notaire, et passons notre contrat aujourd'hui, pour donner au Chevalier la triste conviction qu'il demande.
Mais il me paroit que vous lui faites accroire qu'il la demande; je suis persuadee qu'il ne s'en soucie pas.
HORTENSE, a part, au Chevalier.
Soutenez donc.
Oui, Comtesse, un notaire me feroit plaisir.
Voila un sentiment bien bizarre.
Point du tout.
Ses affaires exigent qu'il sache a quoi s'en tenir: il n'y a rien de si simple, et il a raison; il n'osoit le dire, et je le dis pour lui.
Allez-vous envoyer Lepine, monsieur le Marquis? Comme il vous plaira.
Mais qui est-ce qui songeoit a avoir un notaire aujourd'hui? HORTENSE, au Chevalier.
Je vous en prie, Marquis.
Oh! vous aurez la bonte d'attendre a demain, monsieur le Chevalier.
Vous n'etes pas si presse; votre fantaisie n'est pas d'une espece a meriter qu'on se gene tant pour elle: ce seroit ce soir ici un embarras qui nous derangeroit.
J'ai quelques affaires; demain il sera temps.
HORTENSE, a part, au Chevalier.
Eh! Comtesse, de grace! De grace! L'heteroclite priere! Il est donc bien ragoutant de voir sa maitresse mariee a son rival? Comme Monsieur voudra, au reste.
Il seroit impoli de gener Madame.
Au surplus, je m'en rapporte a elle, demain seroit bon.
Des qu'elle y consent, il n'y a qu'a envoyer Lepine.
Voici Lisette qui entre; je vais lui dire de nous l'aller chercher...
Lisette, on doit passer ce soir un contrat de mariage entre monsieur le Marquis et moi; il veut tout a l'heure faire partir Lepine pour amener son notaire de Paris.
Ayez la bonte de lui dire qu'il vienne recevoir ses ordres.
J'y cours, Madame.
LA COMTESSE, l'arretant.
Ou allez-vous? En fait de mariage, je ne veux ni m'en meler, ni que mes gens s'en melent.
Moi, ce n'est que pour rendre service.
Tenez, je n'ai que faire de sortir: je le vois sur la terrasse.
(Elle appelle.) Monsieur de Lepine? LA COMTESSE, a part.
Cette sotte! Qui est-ce qui m'appelle? Vite, vite, a cheval! Il s'agit d'un contrat de mariage entre Madame et votre maitre, et il faut aller a Paris chercher le notaire de monsieur le Marquis.
LEPINE, au Marquis.
Le notaire! Ce qu'elle conte est-il vrai? Monsieur, nous avons la partie de chasse pour tantot; je me suis arrange pour courir le lievre, et non pas le notaire.
C'est pourtant le dernier qu'on veut.
Ce n'est pas la peine que je voyage pour avoir le votre: je le compte pour mort.
Ne savez-vous pas? La fievre le travailloit quand nous partimes, avec le medecin par-dessus; il en avoit le transport au cerveau.
Vraiment, oui.
A propos, il etoit tres malade.
Il agonisoit, sandis!...
LISETTE, d'un air indifferent.
Il n'y a qu'a prendre celui de Madame.
II n'y a qu'a vous taire, car, si celui de Monsieur est mort, le mien l'est aussi.
deux y a quelque temps qu'il me dit qu'il etoit le sien.
LISETTE, indifferemment, d'un air modeste.
Il me semble qu'il n'y a pas longtemps que vous lui avez ecrit, Madame.
La belle consequence! Ma lettre a-t-elle empeche qu'il ne mourut? Il est certain que je lui ai ecrit, mais aussi ne m'a-t-il point fait de reponse.
LE CHEVALIER, a Hortense, a part.
Je commence a me rassurer.
HORTENSE, lui souriant a part.
Il y a plus d'un notaire a Paris.
Lepine verra s'il se porte mieux.
Depuis six semaines que nous sommes ici, il a eu le temps de revenir en bonne sante.
Allez lui ecrire un mot, monsieur le Marquis, et priez-le, s'il ne peut venir, d'en indiquer un autre.
Lepine ira se preparer pendant que vous ecrirez.
Non, Madame; si je monte a cheval, c'est autant de reste par les chemins.
Je parlois de la partie de chasse, mais voici que je me sens mal, extremement mal: d'aujourd'hui je ne prendrai ni gibier ni notaire.
LISETTE, en souriant negligemment.
Est-ce que vous etes mort aussi? LEPINE, feignant de la douleur.
Non, Mademoiselle; mais je vis souffrant, et je ne pourrois fournir la course.
Ah! sans le respect de la compagnie, je ferois des cris percants.
Je me brisai hier d'une chute sur l'escalier, je roulai tout un etage, et je commencois d'en entamer un autre quand on me retint sur le penchant.
Jugez de la douleur; je la sens qui m'enveloppe.
Eh bien! tu n'as qu'a prendre ma chaise.
Dites-lui qu'il parte, Marquis.
Ce garcon qui est tout froisse, qui a roule un etage, je m'etonne qu'il ne soit pas au lit.
Pars si tu peux, au reste.
Allez, partez, Lepine; on n'est point fatigue dans une chaise.
Vous dirai-je le vrai, Mademoiselle? Obligez-moi de me dispenser de la commission.
Monsieur traite avec vous de sa ruine.
Vous ne l'aimez point, Madame, j'en ai connoissance, et ce mariage ne peut etre que fatal: je me ferois un reproche d'y avoir part.
Je parle en conscience.
Si mon scrupule deplait, qu'on me dise: "Va-t'en." Qu'on me chasse, je m'y soumets: ma probite me console.
Voila ce qu'on appelle un excellent domestique! Ils sont bien rares! LE MARQUIS, a Hortense.
Vous l'entendez.
Comment voulez-vous que je m'y prenne avec cet opiniatre? Quand je me facherais, il n'en sera ni plus ni moins.
Il faut donc le chasser.
(A Lepine.) Retire-toi.
On se passera de lui.
Allez toujours ecrire.
Un de mes gens portera la lettre, ou quelqu'un du village.
Ah ca, vous allez faire votre billet; j'en vais ecrire un qu'on laissera chez moi en passant.
Oui-da; mais consultez-vous: si par hasard vous ne m'aimiez pas, tant pis, car j'y vais de bon jeu.
LE CHEVALIER, a Hortense, a part.
Vous le poussez trop.
HORTENSE, a part.
Paix! (Haut.) Tout est consulte, Monsieur; adieu.
Chevalier, vous voyez bien qu'il ne m'est plus permis de vous ecouter.
Adieu, Mademoiselle; je vais me livrer a la douleur ou vous me laissez.
(Ils sortent.) LE MARQUIS, consterne.
Je n'en reviens point! C'est le diable qui m'en veut.
Vous voulez que cette fille-la m'aime? Non, mais elle est assez mutine pour vous epouser.
Croyez-moi, terminez avec elle.
Si je lui effrois cent mille francs? Mais ils ne sont pas prets; je ne les ai point.
Que cela ne vous retienne pas: je vous les preterai, moi...
Je les ai a Paris.
Rappelez-les; votre situation me fait de la peine.
Courez, je les vois encore tous deux.
Je vous rend mille graces.
(Il appelle.) Madame?  monsieur le Chevalier? Voulez-vous bien revenir? J'ai un petit mot a vous communiquer.
De quoi s'agit-il donc? Vous me rappelez aussi...
Dois-je en tirer un bon augure? Je croyois que vous alliez ecrire.
Rien n'empeche.
Mais c'est que j'ai une proposition a vous faire, et qui est tout a fait raisonnable.
Une proposition! Monsieur le Marquis, vous m'avez donc trompee? Votre amour n'est pas aussi vrai que vous me l'avez dit.
Que diantre voulez-vous? On pretend aussi que vous ne m'aimez point: cela me chicane.
Je ne vous aime pas encore, mais je vous aimerai; et puis, Monsieur, avec de la vertu, on se passe d'amour pour un mari.
Oh! je serais un mari qui ne s'en passeroit pas, moi! Nous ne gagnerions, a nous marier, que le loisir de nous quereller a notre aise, et ce n'est pas la une partie de plaisir bien touchante.
Ainsi, tenez, accommodons- nous plutot.
Partageons le differend en deux: il y a deux cent mille francs sur le testament, prenez-en la moitie, quoique vous ne m'aimiez pas, et laissons la tous les notaires, tant vivants que morts.
LE CHEVALIER, a Hortense, a part.
Je ne crains plus rien.
Vous n'y pensez pas, Monsieur; cent mille francs ne peuvent entrer en comparaison avec l'avantage de vous epouser, et vous ne vous evaluez pas ce que vous valez.
Ma foi, je ne les vaux pas quand je suis de mauvaise humeur, et je vous annonce que j'y serai toujours.
Ma douceur naturelle me rassure.
Vous ne voulez donc pas? Allons notre chemin, vous serez mariee.
C'est le plus court, et je m'en retourne.
Et moi je dirai que je vous aime.
Qui est-ce qui me prouvera le contraire, des que je vous accepte? Je soutiendrai que c'est vous qui ne m'aimez pas, et qui meme, dit-on, en aime une autre.
Du moins, en tout cas, ne la connoit-on point comme on connoit le Chevalier.
Tout de meme, Monsieur, je la connois, moi.
Eh! finissez.
Monsieur, finissez! Ah! l'odieuse contestation! Oui, finissons.
Je vous epouserai, Monsieur: il n'y a que cela a dire.
Eh bien! et moi aussi, Madame, et moi aussi.
Epousez donc.
Oui, parbleu! j'en aurai le plaisir; il faudra bien que l'amour vous vienne; et, pour debut de mariage, je pretends, s'il vous plait, que monsieur le Chevalier ait la bonte d'etre notre ami de tres loin.
LE CHEVALIER, a Hortense, a part.
Ceci ne vaut rien; il se pique.
HORTENSE, au Chevalier.
Taisez-vous! (Au Marquis) Monsieur le Chevalier me connoit assez pour etre persuade qu'il ne me verra plus.
Adieu, Monsieur: je vais ecrire mon billet, tenez le votre pret: ne perdons point de temps.
Oh! pour votre contrat, je vous certifie que vous irez le signer ou il vous plaira, mais que ce ne sera pas chez moi.
C'est s'egorger que se marier comme vous faites, et je ne preterai jamais ma maison pour une si funeste ceremonie.
Vos fureurs iront se passer ailleurs, si vous le trouvez bon.
Eh bien! Comtesse, la Marquise est votre voisine, nous irons chez elle.
Oui, si j'en suis d'avis: car, enfin, cela depend de moi.
Je ne connois point votre Marquise.
HORTENSE, en s'en allant.
N'importe, vous y consentirez, Monsieur.
Je vous quitte.
LE CHEVALIER, en s'en allant.
A tout ce que je vois, mon esperance renait un peu.
LA COMTESSE, arretant le Chevalier.
Restez, Chevalier; parlons un peu de ceci.
Y eut-il jamais rien de pareil? Qu'en pensez-vous, vous qui aimez Hortense, vous qu'elle aime? Le mariage ne vous fait-il pas trembler? Moi qui ne suis pas son amant, il m'effraye.
LE CHEVALIER, avec un effroi hypocrite.
C'est une chose affreuse! Il n'y a point d'exemple de cela.
Je ne m'en soucie guere.
Elle sera ma femme; mais, en revanche, je serai son mari: c'est ce qui me console, et ce sont plus ses affaires que les miennes.
Aujourd'hui le contrat, demain la noce, et ce soir confinee dans son appartement: pas plus de facon.
Je suis pique, je ne donnerois pas cela de plus.
Pour moi, je serois d'avis qu'on les empechat absolument de s'engager, et un notaire honnete homme, s'il etoit instruit, leur refuseroit tout net son ministere.
Je les enfermerois si j'etois la maitresse.
Hortense peut-elle se sacrifier a un aussi vil interet? Vous qui etes ne genereux, Chevalier, et qui avez du pouvoir sur elle, retenez-la; faites-lui, par pitie, entendre raison, si ce n'est par amour.
Je suis sure qu'elle ne marchande si vilainement qu'a cause de vous.
LE CHEVALIER, a part.
Il n'y a plus de risque a tenir bon.
(Haut.) Que voulez-vous que j'y fasse, Comtesse? Je n'y vois point de remede.
Comment? que dites-vous? Il faut que j'aie mal entendu, car je vous estime.
Je dis que je ne puis rien la-dedans, et que c'est ma tendresse qui me defend de la resoudre a ce que vous souhaitez.
Et par quel trait d'esprit me prouverez-vous la justesse de ce petit raisonnement-la? Oui, Madame, je veux qu'elle soit heureuse.
Si je l'epouse, elle ne le seroit pas assez avec la fortune que j'ai.
La douceur de notre union s'altereroit; je la verrois se repentir de m'avoir epouse, de n'avoir pas epouse Monsieur, et c'est a quoi je ne m'exposerai point.
On ne peut vous repondre qu'en haussant les epaules.
Est-ce vous qui me parlez, Chevalier? Oui, Madame.
Vous avez donc l'ame mercenaire aussi, mon petit cousin? Je ne m'etonne plus de l'inclination que vous avez l'un pour l'autre.
Ou, vous etes digne d'elle; vos coeurs sont fort bien assortis.
Ah! l'horrible facon d'aimer! Madame, la vraie tendresse ne raisonne pas autrement que la mienne.
Ah! Monsieur, ne prononcez pas seulement le mot de tendresse, vous le profanez.
Mais...
Vous me scandalisez, vous dis-je! Vous etes mon parent, malheureusement; mais je ne m'en vanterai point.
N'avez-vous pas de honte? Vous parlez de votre fortune.
je la connois; elle vous met fort en etat de supporter le retranchement d'une aussi miserable somme que celle dont il s'agit, et qui ne peut jamais etre que mal acquise.
Ah! Ciel! Moi qui vous estimois! Quelle avarice sordide! quel coeur sans sentiment! Et de pareils gens disent qu'ils aiment! Ah! le vilain amour! Vous pouvez vous retirer, je n'ai plus rien a vous dire.
LE MARQUIS, brusquement.
Ni moi plus rien a craindre.
Le billet va partir.
Vous avez encore trois heures a entretenir Hortense, apres quoi j'espere qu'on ne vous verra plus.
Monsieur, le contrat signe, je pars.
Pour vous, Comtesse, quand vous y penserez bien serieusement, vous excuserez votre parent et vous lui rendrez plus de justice.
Ah! non! Voila qui est fini, je ne saurois le mepriser davantage.
Eh bien! suis-je assez a plaindre? Eh! Monsieur, delivrez-vous d'elle et donnez-lui les deux cent mille francs.
Deux cent mille francs plutot que de l'epouser! Non, parbleu! je n'irai pas m'incommoder jusque-la; je ne pourrois pas les trouver sans me deranger.
LA COMTESSE, negligemment.
Ne vous ai-je pas dit que j'ai justement la moitie de cette somme-la toute prete? A l'egard du reste, on tachera de vous la faire.
Eh! quand on emprunte, ne faut-il pas rendre? Si vous aviez voulu de moi, a la bonne heure; mais, des qu'il n'y a rien a faire, je retiens la demoiselle: elle seroit trop chere a renvoyer.
Trop chere! Prenez donc garde! vous parlez comme eux.
Seriez-vous capable de sentiments si mesquins? Il vaudrait mieux qu'il vous en coutat tout votre bien que de la retenir, puisque vous ne l'aimez pas, Monsieur.
Eh! en aimerois-je une autre davantage? A l'exception de vous, toute femme m'est egale.
Brune, blonde, petite ou grande, tout cela revient au meme, puisque je ne vous ai pas, que je ne puis vous avoir et qu'il n'y a que vous que j'aimois.
Voyez donc comment vous ferez, car enfin est-ce une necessite que je vous epouse a cause de la situation desagreable oh vous etes? En verite, cela me paroit bien fort, Marquis.
Oh! je ne dis pas que ce soit une necessite: vous me faites plus ridicule que je ne le suis.
Je sais bien que vous n'etes obligee a rien.
Ce n'est pas votre faute si je vous aime, et je ne pretends pas que vous m'aimiez.
Je ne vous en parle point non plus.
LA COMTESSE, impatiente, et d'un ton serieux.
Vous faites fort bien, Monsieur; votre discretion est tout a fait raisonnable.
Je m'y attendois, et vous avez tort de croire que je vous fais plus ridicule que vous ne l'etes.
Tout le mal qu'il y a, c'est que j'epouserai cette fille-ci avec un peu plus de peine que je n'en aurois eu sans vous.
Voila toute l'obligation que je vous ai.
Adieu, Comtesse.
Adieu, Marquis.
Vous vous en allez donc gaillardement comme cela, sans imaginer d'autre expedient que ce contrat extravagant? Eh! quel expedient? Je n'en savois qu'un, qui n'a pas reussi, et je n'en sais plus.
Je suis votre tres humble serviteur.
Bonsoir, Monsieur.
Ne perdez point de temps en reverences: la chose presse.
LA COMTESSE, seule.
Qu'on me dise en vertu de quoi cet homme-la s'est mis dans la tete que je ne l'aime point! Je suis quelquefois, par impatience, tentee de lui dire que je l'aime, pour lui montrer qu'il n'est qu'un idiot...
Il faut que je me satisfasse.
Puis-je prendre la licence de m'approcher de madame la Comtesse! Qu'as-tu a me dire? De nous rendre reconcilies monsieur le Marquis et moi.
Il est vrai qu'avec l'esprit tourne comme il l'a, il est homme a te punir de l'avoir bien servi.
J'ai le contentement que vous avez approuve mon refus de partir.
Il vous a semble que j'etois un serviteur excellent.
Madame, ce sont les termes de la louange dont votre justice m'a gratifie.
Oui, excellent, je le dis encore.
C'est cependant mon excellence qui fait aujourd'hui que je chancelle dans mon poste.
Tout estime que je suis de la plus aimable comtesse, elle verra qu'on me supprime.
Non, non, il n'y a pas d'apparence.
Je parlerai pour toi.
Madame, enseignez a monsieur le Marquis le merite de mon procede.
Ce notaire me consternoit.
Je n'entends pas ce que cela veut dire.
Le voici au net: elle pretend que votre etat de veuve lui rapporte davantage que ne feroit votre etat de femme en puissance d'epoux; que vous lui etes plus profitable, autrement dit, plus lucrative.
Il faut excuser la servitude.
Se fache-t-on qu'une fourmi rampe? La mediocrite de l'etat fait que les pensees sont mediocres.
Lisette n'a point de bien, et c'est avec de petits sentiments qu'on en amasse.
L'impertinente! la voici.
Va, laisse-nous; je te raccommoderai avec ton maitre.
Dis-lui que je le prie de me venir parler.
LEPINE, a Lisette.
Mademoiselle, vous allez trouver le temps orageux; mais ce n'est qu'une gentillesse de ma facon pour obtenir votre coeur.
(Il s'en va.) LISETTE, s'approchant de la Comtesse.
Que veut-il dire? Ah! c'est donc vous? Oui, Madame, et la poste n'etoit point partie.
Eh bien! que vous a dit le Marquis? Vous meritez bien que je l'epouse.
Je ne sais pas en quoi je le merite; mois ce qui est de certain, c'est que, toute reflexion faite, je venois pour vous le conseiller.
(A part.) Il faut ceder au torrent.
Vous me surprenez.
Et vos profits, que deviendront-ils? Qu'est-ce que c'est que mes profits? Oui, vous ne gagneriez plus tant avec moi si j'avois un mari, avez-vous dit a Lepine.
Mais, en bonne foi, me reconnoissez-vous au discours qu'il me fait tenir? Y a-t-il meme du bon sens? M'en aimerez-vous moins quand vous serez mariee? en serez-vous moins bonne, moins genereuse? Je ne pense pas.
Surtout avec le Marquis, qui, de son cote, est le meilleur homme du monde.
Ainsi, qu'est-ce que j'y perdrois? Au contraire, si j'aime tant mes profits, avec vos bienfaits je pourrai encore esperer les siens.
Sans difficulte.
Et enfin je pense si differemment que je venois actuellement, comme je vous l'ai dit, tacher de vous porter au mariage en question, parce que je le juge necessaire.
Voila qui est bien: je vous crois.
Je ne savois pas que Lepine vous aimait, et cela change tout: c'est un article qui vous justifie.
Oui, mais on vous previent bien aisement contre moi.
Madame; vous ne rendez guere justice a mon attachement pour vous.
Tu te trompes: je sais ce que tu vaux, et je n'etois pas si persuadee que tu te l'imagines.
N'en parlons plus.
Qu'est-ce que tu me voulois dire? Que je songeois que le Marquis est un homme estimable.
Sans contredit.
Je n'ai jamais pense autrement.
Un homme en qui vous aurez l'agrement d'avoir un ami sur sans avoir de maitre.
Cela est encore vrai: ce n'est pas la ce que je dispute.
Vos affaires vous fatiguent.
Plus que je ne puis dire.
Je les entends mal, et je suis une paresseuse.
Vous en avez des instants de mauvaise humeur qui nuisent a votre sante.
Je n'ai connu mes migraines que depuis mon veuvage.
Procureurs, avocats, fermiers, le Marquis vous delivreroit de tous ces gens-la.
Je t'avoue que tu as reflechi la-dessus plus murement que moi.
Jusqu'ici je n'ai point de raisons qui combattent les tiennes.
Savez-vous bien que c'est peut-etre le seul homme qui vous convienne? Il faut donc que j'y reve.
Vous ne vous sentez point de l'eloignement pour lui? Non, aucun.
Je ne dis pas que je l'aime de ce qu'on appelle passion; mais je n'ai rien dans le coeur qui lui soit contraire.
Eh! n'est-ce pas assez, vraiment? De la passion! Si, pour vous marier, vous attendez qu'il vous en vienne, vous resterez toujours veuve; et, a proprement parler, ce n'est pas lui que je vous propose d'epouser, c'est son caractere.
Qui est admirable, j'en conviens.
Et puis, voyez le service que vous lui rendrez, chemin faisant, en rompant le triste mariage qu'il va conclure plus par desespoir que par interet.
Oui, c'est une bonne action que je ferai, et il est louable d'en faire autant qu'on peut.
Surtout quand il n'en coute rien au coeur.
On peut dire assurement que tu plaides bien pour lui.
Tu me disposes on ne peut pas mieux; mais il n'aura pas l'esprit d'en profiter, mon enfant.
D'ou vient donc? Ne vous a-t-il pas parle de son amour? Oui, il m'a dit qu'il m'aimoit, et mon premier mouvement a ete d'en paraitre etonnee: c'etoit bien le moins.
Sais-tu ce qui est arrive? Qu'il a pris mon etonnement pour de la colere.
Il a commence par etablir que je ne pouvois pas le souffrir.
En un mot, je le deteste, je suis furieuse contre son amour: voila d'ou il part; moyennant quoi je ne saurais le desabuser sans lui dire: "Monsieur, vous ne savez ce que vous dites;" et ce seroit me jeter a sa tete.
Aussi n'en ferai-je rien.
Oh! c'est une autre affaire: vous avez raison; ce n'est point ce que je vous conseille non plus, et il n'y a qu'a le laisser la.
Bon! Tu veux que je l'epouse, tu veux que je le laisse la; tu te promenes d'une extremite a l'autre.
Eh! peut-etre n'a-t-il pas tant de tort, et que c'est ma faute.
Je lui reponds quelquefois avec aigreur.
J'y pensois: c'est ce que j'allois vous dire.
Voulez-vous que j'en parle a Lepine, et que je lui insinue de l'encourager? Non, je te le defends, Lisette, a moins que je n'y sois pour rien.
Apparemment, ce n'est pas vous qui vous en avisez: c'est moi.
En ce cas, je n'y prends point de part.
Si je l'epouse, c'est a toi a qui il en aura obligation et je pretends qu'il le sache, afin qu'il t'en recompense.
Comme il vous plaira, Madame.
A propos, cette robe brune qui me deplait, l'as-tu prise? J'ai oublie de te dire que je te la donne.
Voyez comme votre mariage diminuera mes profits! Je vous quitte pour chercher Lepine; mais ce n'est pas la peine; voila le Marquis, et je vous laisse.
Voici cette lettre que je viens de faire pour le notaire; mais je ne sais pas si elle partira: je ne suis pas d'accord avec moi-meme.
On dit que vous souhaitez me parler, Comtesse.
Oui, c'est en faveur de Lepine.
Il n'a voulu que vous rendre service; il craint que vous ne le congediiez, et vous m'obligerez de le garder: c'est une grace que vous ne me refuserez pas, puisque vous dites que vous m'aimez.
Vraiment oui, je vous aime, et ne vous aimerai encore que trop longtemps.
Je ne vous en empeche pas.
Parbleu! je vous en defierois, puisque je ne saurois m'en empecher moi- meme.
LA COMTESSE, riant.
Ha! ha! ha! Ce ton brusque me fait rire.
Oh! oui, la chose est fort plaisante! Plus que vous ne pensez.
Ma foi, je pense que je voudrois ne vous avoir jamais vue.
Votre inclination s'explique avec des graces infinies.
C'est que monsieur est un extravagant.
C'est, du moins, le plus insupportable homme que je connoisse.
Oui, vous pouvez etre persuade qu'il n'y a rien de si original que vos conversations avec moi, de si incroyable.
Comme votre aversion m'accommode! Vous allez voir.
Tenez, vous dites que vous m'aimez, n'est-ce pas? et je vous crois.
Mais voyons: que souhaiteriez-vous que je vous repondisse? Ce que je souhaiterois? Voila qui est bien difficile a deviner! Parbleu! vous le savez de reste.
Eh bien! ne l'ai-je pas dit? Est-ce la me repondre? Allez, Monsieur, je ne vous aimerai jamais, non, jamais.
Tant pis, Madame tant pis.
Je vous prie de trouver bon que j'en sois fache.
Apprenez donc, lorsqu'on dit aux gens qu'on les aime, qu'il faut du moins leur demander ce qu'ils en pensent.
Quelle chicane vous me faites! Je n'y saurais tenir.
Eh bien! Madame, je vous aime.
Qu'en pensez-vous? Et, encore une fois, qu'en pensez-vous? Ah! ce que je pense? Que je le veux bien, Monsieur; et, encore une fois, que je le veux bien: car, si je ne m'y prenois pas de cette facon, nous ne finirions jamais.
Ah! vous le voulez bien? Ah! je respire! Comtesse, donnez-moi votre main, que je la baise.
Votre billet est-il pret, Marquis? Mais vous baisez la main de la Comtesse, ce me semble? Oui, c'est pour la remercier du peu de regret que j'ai aux deux cent mille francs que je vous donne.
Et moi, sans compliment, je vous remercie de vouloir bien les perdre.
Nous voila donc contents.
Que je vous embrasse, Marquis! (A la Comtesse.) Comtesse, voila le denouement que nous attendions.
LA COMTESSE, en s'en allant.
Eh bien! vous n'attendrez plus.
LISETTE, a Lepine.
Maraud, je crois, en effet, qu'il faudra que je t'epouse.
Je l'avois entrepris.
Representee pour la premiere fois par les Comediens Italiens ordinaires du Roi, le seize mars mille sept cent trente-sept.
ARAMINTE, fille de Madame Argante.
DORANTE, neveu de Monsieur Remy.
Monsieur REMY, procureur.
Madame ARGANTE.
ARLEQUIN, valet d'Araminte.
DUBOIS, ancien valet de Dorante.
MARTON, suivante d'Araminte.
Un DOMESTIQUE parlant Un GARCON joaillier.
La scene est chez Madame Argante.
ARLEQUIN, introduisant Dorante.
Ayez la bonte, Monsieur, de vous asseoir un moment dans cette salle; Mademoiselle Marton est chez Madame, et ne tardera pas a descendre.
Je vous suis oblige.
Si vous voulez, je vous tiendrai compagnie, de peur que l'ennui ne vous prenne; nous discourrons en attendant.
Je vous remercie; ce n'est pas la peine, ne vous detournez point.
Voyez, Monsieur, n'en faites pas de facon: nous avons ordre de Madame d'etre honnete, et vous etes temoin que je le suis.
Non, vous dis-je; je serai bien aise d'etre un moment seul.
Excusez, Monsieur, et restez a votre fantaisie.
DORANTE, DUBOIS, entrant avec un air de mystere.
Ah! te voila? Oui, je vous guettois.
J'ai cru que je ne pourrais me debarrasser d'un domestique qui m'a introduit ici, et qui vouloit absolument me desennuyer en restant.
Dis- moi, monsieur Remy n'est donc pas encore venu? Non; mais voici l'heure a peu pres qu'il vous a dit qu'il arriveroit.
(Il cherche et regarde.) N'y a-t-il la personne qui nous voie ensemble? Il est essentiel que les domestiques ici ne sachent pas que je vous connoisse.
Je ne vois personne.
Vous n'avez rien dit de notre projet a monsieur Remy, votre parent? Pas le moindre mot.
Il me presente de la meilleure foi du monde, en qualite d'intendant, a cette dame-ci, dont je lui ai parle, et dont il se trouve le procureur; il ne sait point du tout que c'est toi qui m'as adresse a lui.
Il la prevint hier; il m'a dit que je me rendisse ce matin ici, qu'il me presenteroit a elle, qu'il y seroit avant moi, ou que, s'il n'y etoit pas encore, je demandasse une mademoiselle Marton.
Voila tout, et je n'aurois garde de lui confier notre projet, non plus qu'a personne: il me paroit extravagant a moi qui m'y prete.
Je n'en suis pourtant pas moins sensible a ta bonne volonte.
Dubois, tu m'as servi, je n'ai pu te garder, je n'ai pu meme te bien recompenser de ton zele; malgre cela, il t'est venu dans l'esprit de faire ma fortune: en verite, il n'est point de reconnoissance que je ne te doive.
Laissons cela, Monsieur; tenez, en un mot, je suis content de vous, vous m'avez toujours plu; vous etes un excellent homme, un homme que j'aime; et, si j'avois bien de l'argent, il seroit encore a votre service.
Quand pourrai-je reconnoitre tes sentiments pour moi? Ma fortune seroit la tienne.
Mais je n'attends rien de notre entreprise, que la honte d'etre renvoye demain.
Eh bien! vous vous en retournerez.
Tournez-vous un peu, que je vous considere encore.
Allons, Monsieur, vous vous moquez, il n'y a point de plus grand seigneur que vous a Paris, Voila une taille qui vaut toutes les dignites possibles, et notre affaire est infaillible: il me semble que je vous vois deja en deshabille dans l'appartement de Madame.
Quelle chimere! Oui, je le soutiens; vous etes actuellement dans votre salle, et vos equipages sont sous la remise.
Elle a plus de cinquante mille livres de rente, Dubois.
Ah! vous en avez bien soixante pour le moins.
Et tu me dis qu'elle est extremement raisonnable.
Tant mieux pour vous, et tant pis pour elle.
Si vous lui plaisez, elle en sera si honteuse, elle se debattra tant, elle deviendra si foible, qu'elle ne pourra se soutenir qu'en epousant; vous m'en direz des nouvelles.
Vous l'avez vue, et vous l'aimez.
Je l'aime avec passion, et c'est ce qui fait que je tremble.
Oh! vous m'impatientez avec vos terreurs: eh! que diantre! un peu de confiance; vous reussirez, vous dis-je.
Quand l'amour parle, il est le maitre, et il parlera.
Adieu; je vous quitte.
J'entends quelqu'un: c'est peut-etre monsieur Remy.
Nous voila embarques, poursuivons.
(Il fait quelques pas, et revient.) A propos, tachez que Marton prenne un peu de gout pour vous.
L'amour et moi nous ferons le reste.
Bonjour, mon neveu; je suis bien aise de vous voir exact.
Mademoiselle Marton va venir; on est alle l'avertir.
La connoissez-vous? Non, Monsieur; pourquoi me le demandez-vous? C'est qu'en venant ici j'ai reve a une chose...
Elle est jolie, au moins.
Je le crois.
Et de fort bonne famille.
Marton a d'ailleurs une vieille parente asthmatique dont elle herite, et qui est a son aise.
Vous allez etre tous deux dans la meme maison; je suis d'avis que vous l'epousiez; qu'en dites- vous? DORANTE, sourit a part.
Eh!...
mais je ne pensois pas a elle.
Eh bien! je vous avertis d'y penser; tachez de lui plaire.
Vous n'avez rien, mon neveu, je dis rien qu'un peu d'esperance; vous etes mon heritier, mais je me porte bien, et je ferai durer cela le plus longtemps que je pourrai, sans compter que je puis me marier.
Je n'en ai point d'envie; mais cette envie-la vient tout d'un coup; il y a tant de minois qui vous la donnent! Avec une femme on a des enfants, c'est la coutume; auquel cas, serviteur au collateral.
Ainsi, mon neveu, prenez toujours vos petites precautions, et vous mettez en etat de vous passer de mon bien, que je vous destine aujourd'hui, et que je vous oterai demain peut- etre.
Vous avez raison, Monsieur, et c'est aussi a quoi je vais travailler.
Je vous y exhorte.
Voici mademoiselle Marton: eloignez-vous de deux pas, pour me donner le temps de lui demander comment elle vous trouve.
(Dorante s'ecarte un peu.) Je suis fachee, Monsieur, de vous avoir fait attendre; mais j'avois affaire chez Madame.
Il n'y a pas grand mal, Mademoiselle, j'arrive.
Que pensez-vous de ce grand garcon-la? (Montrant Dorante.) MARTON, riant.
Eh! par quelle raison, monsieur Remy, faut-il que je vous le dise? C'est qu'il est mon neveu.
Eh bien! ce neveu-la est bon a montrer; il ne depare point la famille.
Tout de bon? C'est de lui dont j'ai parle a Madame pour intendant, et je suis charme qu'il vous revienne.
Il vous a deja vue plus d'une fois chez moi quand vous y etes venue; vous en souvenez-vous? Non, je n'en ai point d'idee.
On ne prend pas garde a tout.
Savez-vous ce qu'il me dit la premiere fois qu'il vous vit? "Quelle est cette jolie fille-la?" (Marton sourit.) Approchez, mon neveu.
Mademoiselle, votre pere et le sien s'aimoient beaucoup; pourquoi les enfants ne s'aimeroient-ils pas? En voila un qui ne demande pas mieux; c'est un coeur qui se presente bien.
DORANTE, embarrasse.
II n'y a rien la de difficile a croire.
Voyez comme il vous regarde.
Vous ne feriez pas la une si mauvaise emplette.
J'en suis persuadee; Monsieur previent en sa faveur, et il faudra voir.
Bon, bon! il faudra! Je ne m'en irai point que cela ne soit vu.
MARTON, riant.
Je craindrois d'aller trop vite.
Vous importunez Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
MARTON, riant.
Je n'ai pourtant pas l'air si indocile.
Monsieur REMY, joyeux.
Ah! je suis content, vous voila d'accord.
Oh! ca, mes enfants (il leur prend les mains a tous deux), je vous fiance en attendant mieux.
Je ne saurois rester; je reviendrai tantot.
Je vous laisse le soin de presenter votre futur a Madame.
Adieu, ma niece.
(Il sort.) MARTON, riant.
Adieu donc, mon oncle.
En verite, tout ceci a l'air d'un songe.
Comme monsieur Remy expedie! Votre amour me paroit bien prompt: sera-t-il aussi durable? Autant l'un que l'autre, Mademoiselle.
Il s'est trop hate de partir.
J'entends Madame qui vient, et comme, graces aux arrangements de monsieur Remy, vos interets sont presque les miens, ayez la bonte d'aller un moment sur la terrasse, afin que je la previenne.
Volontiers, Mademoiselle.
MARTON, en le voyant sortir.
J'admire ce penchant dont on se prend tout d'un coup l'un pour l'autre.
Marton, quel est donc cet homme qui vient de me saluer si gracieusement, et qui passe sur la terrasse? Est-ce a vous a qui il en veut? Non, Madame, c'est a vous-meme.
ARAMINTE, d'un air assez vif.
Eh bien! qu'on le fasse venir; pourquoi s'en va-t-il? C'est qu'il a souhaite que je vous parlasse auparavant.
C'est le neveu de monsieur Remy, celui qu'il vous a propose pour homme d'affaires.
Ah! c'est la lui! Il a vraiment tres bonne facon.
Il est generalement estime, je le sais.
Je n'ai pas de peine a le croire: il a tout l'air de le meriter.
Mais, Marton, il a si bonne mine, pour un intendant, que je me fais quelque scrupule de le prendre: n'en dira-t-on rien? Et que voulez-vous qu'on dise? Est-on oblige de n'avoir que des intendants mal faits? Tu as raison.
Dis-lui qu'il revienne.
Il n'etoit pas necessaire de me preparer a le recevoir: des que c'est monsieur Remy qui me le donne, c'en est assez; je le prends.
MARTON, comme s'en allant.
Vous ne sauriez mieux choisir.
(Et puis revenant.) Etes-vous convenue du parti  que vous lui faites? Monsieur Remy m'a charge de vous en parler.
Cela est inutile.
Il n'y aura point de dispute la-dessus.
Des que c'est un honnete homme, il aura lieu d'etre content.
MARTON, hesitant de partir.
On lui laissera ce petit appartement qui donne sur le jardin, n'est-ce pas? Oui; comme il voudra.
Qu'il vienne.
(Marton va dans la coulisse.) Monsieur Dorante, Madame vous attend.
Venez, Monsieur; je suis obligee a monsieur Remy d'avoir songe a moi.
Puisqu'il me donne son neveu, je ne doute pas que ce ne soit un present qu'il me fasse.
Un de mes amis me parla avant-hier d'un intendant qu'il doit m'envoyer aujourd'hui; mais je m'en tiens a vous.
J'espere, Madame, que mon zele justifiera la preference dont vous m'honorez, et que je vous supplie de me conserver.
Rien ne m'affligeroit tant a present que de la perdre.
Madame n'a pas deux paroles.
Non, Monsieur; c'est une affaire terminee, je renverrai tout.
Vous etes au fait des affaires, apparemment; vous y avez travaille? Oui, Madame; mon pere etoit avocat, et je pourrois l'etre moi-meme.
Mes facons ne vous feront point changer de sentiment.
Vous trouverez ici tous les egards que vous meritez; et si, dans la suite, il y avoit occasion de vous rendre service, je ne la manquerai point.
Voila Madame, je la reconnois.
Ce qu'il y a de consolant pour vous, c'est que vous avez le temps de devenir heureux.
Je commence a l'etre aujourd'hui, Madame.
On vous montrera l'appartement que je vous destine; s'il ne vous convient pas, il y en a d'autres, et vous choisirez.
Il faut aussi quelqu'un qui vous serve, et c'est a quoi je vais pourvoir.
Qui lui donnerons-nous, Marton? Il n'y a qu'a prendre Arlequin, Madame.
Je le vois a l'entree de la salle, et je vais l'appeler.
Arlequin, parlez a Madame.
Me voila, Madame.
Arlequin, vous etes a present a Monsieur; vous le servirez; je vous donne a lui.
Comment, Madame, vous me donnez a lui? Est-ce que je ne serai plus a moi? Ma personne ne m'appartiendra donc plus? Quel benet! J'entends qu'au lieu de me servir, ce sera lui que tu serviras.
ARLEQUIN, comme pleurant.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi Madame me donne mon conge: je n'ai pas merite ce traitement; je l'ai toujours servie a faire plaisir.
Je ne te donne point ton conge, je te payerai pour etre a Monsieur.
Je represente a Madame que cela ne seroit pas juste: je ne donnerai pas ma peine d'un cote, pendant que l'argent me viendra d'un autre.
Il faut que vous ayez mon service, puisque j'aurai vos gages; autrement je friponnerois Madame.
Je desespere de lui faire entendre raison.
Tu es bien sot! Quand je t'envoie quelque part, ou que je te dis: "Fais telle ou telle chose," n'obeis-tu pas? Toujours.
Eh bien! ce sera Monsieur qui te le dira comme moi, et ce sera a la place de Madame et par son ordre.
Ah! c'est une autre affaire.
C'est Madame qui donnera ordre a Monsieur de souffrir mon service, que je lui preterai par le commandement de Madame.
Voila ce que c'est.
Vous voyez bien que cela meritoit explication.
UN DOMESTIQUE vient.
Voici votre marchande qui vous apporte des etoffes, Madame.
Je vais les voir, et je reviendrai.
Monsieur, j'ai a vous parler d'une affaire; ne vous eloignez pas.
Oh! ca, Monsieur, nous sommes donc l'un a l'autre, et vous avez le pas sur moi.
Je serai le valet qui sert, et vous le valet qui serez servi par ordre.
Ce faquin, avec ses comparaisons! Va-t'en.
Un moment, avec votre permission.
Monsieur, ne payerez-vous rien? Vous a- t-on donne ordre d'etre servi gratis? (Dorante rit.) Allons, laisse-nous.
Madame te payera; n'est-ce pas assez? Pardi, Monsieur, je ne vous couterai donc guere? On ne sauroit avoir un valet a meilleur marche.
Arlequin a raison.
Tiens, voila d'avance ce que je te donne.
Ah! voila une action de maitre.
A votre aise le reste.
Va boire a ma sante.
ARLEQUIN, s'en allant.
Oh! s'il ne faut que boire afin qu'elle soit bonne, tant  que je vivrai je vous la promets excellente.
(A part.) Le gracieux camarade qui m'est venu la par hasard.
DORANTE, MARTON, Mme.
ARGANTE, qui arrive un instant apres.
Vous avez, lieu d'etre satisfait de l'accueil de Madame; elle paroit faire cas de vous, et tant mieux, nous n'y perdons point.
Mais voici madame Argante; je vous avertis que c'est sa mere, et je devine a peu pres ce qui l'amene.
ARGANTE, femme brusque et vaine.
Eh bien, Marton, ma fille a un nouvel intendant que son procureur lui a donne, m'a-t-elle dit: j'en suis fachee; cela n'est point obligeant pour monsieur le Comte, qui lui en avoit retenu un: du moins devoit-elle attendre, et les voir tous deux.
D'ou vient preferer celui-ci? Quelle espece d'homme est-ce? C'est Monsieur, Madame.
Eh! c'est Monsieur! Je ne m'en serais pas doutee: il est bien jeune.
A trente ans, on est en age d'etre intendant de maison, Madame.
C'est selon.
Etes-vous arrete, Monsieur? Oui, Madame.
Et de chez qui sortez-vous? De chez moi, Madame; je n'ai encore ete chez personne.
De chez vous! Vous allez donc faire ici votre apprentissage? Point du tout.
Monsieur entend les affaires; il est fils d'un pere extremement habile.
ARGANTE, a Marton, a part.
Je n'ai pas grande opinion de cet homme-la.
Est-ce la la figure d'un intendant? Il n'en a non plus l'air...
MARTON, a part aussi.
L'air n'y fait rien: je vous reponds de lui; c'est l'homme qu'il nous faut.
Pourvu que Monsieur ne s'ecarte pas des intentions que nous avons, il me sera indifferent que ce soit lui ou un autre.
Peut-on savoir ces intentions, Madame? Mme.
Les paroles sont-elles donnees de part et d'autre? Mme.
Pas tout a fait encore, mais a peu pres: ma fille n'en est pas eloignee.
Elle souhaiteroit seulement, dit-elle, d'etre bien instruite de l'etat de l'affaire, et savoir si elle n'a pas meilleur droit que monsieur le Comte, afin que, si elle l'epouse, il lui en ait plus d'obligation.
Mais j'ai quelquefois peur que ce ne soit une defaite.
Ma fille n'a qu'un defaut, c'est que je ne lui trouve pas assez d'elevation; le beau nom de Dorimont et le rang de comtesse ne la touchent pas assez; elle ne sent pas le desagrement qu'il y a de n'etre qu'une bourgeoise.
Elle s'endort dans cet etat, malgre le bien qu'elle a.
DORANTE, doucement.
Peut-etre n'en sera-t-elle pas plus heureuse si elle en sort.
ARGANTE, vivement.
Il ne s'agit pas de ce que vous en pensez; gardez votre petite reflexion roturiere, et servez-nous, si vous voulez etre de nos amis.
C'est un petit trait de morale qui ne gate rien a notre affaire.
Morale subalterne qui me deplait.
De quoi est-il question, Madame? Mme.
De dire a ma fille, quand vous aurez vu ses papiers, que son droit est le moins bon; que, si elle plaidoit.
elle perdroit.
Si effectivement son droit est le plus foible, je ne manquerai pas de l'en avertir.
Madame, Mme.
ARGANTE, a part, a Marton.
Hum! quel esprit borne! (A Dorante.) Vous n'y etes point; ce n'est pas la ce qu'on vous dit; on vous charge de lui parler ainsi independamment de son droit bien ou mal fonde.
Mais, Madame, il n'y auroit point de probite a la tromper.
De probite! J'en manque donc, moi? Quel raisonnement! C'est moi qui suis sa mere, et qui vous ordonne de la tromper a son avantage, entendez-vous? c'est moi, moi.
Il y aura toujours de la mauvaise foi de ma part.
ARGANTE, a part, a Marton.
C'est un ignorant que cela, qu'il faut renvoyer.
Adieu, monsieur l'homme d'affaires, qui n'avez fait celles de personne.
(Elle sort.) Cette mere-la ne ressemble guere a sa fille.
Oui, il y a quelque difference, et je suis fachee de n'avoir pas eu le temps de vous prevenir sur son humeur brusque.
Elle est extremement entetee de ce mariage, comme vous voyez.
Au surplus, que vous importe ce que vous direz a la fille, des que la mere sera votre garant? Vous n'aurez rien a vous reprocher, ce me semble; ce ne sera pas la une tromperie.
Eh! vous m'excuserez; ce sera toujours l'engager a prendre un parti qu'elle ne prendroit peut-etre pas sans cela.
Puisque l'on veut que j'aide a l'y determiner, elle y resiste donc? C'est par indolence.
Croyez-moi, disons la verite.
Tenez, Mademoiselle Marton, vous etes la plus aimable fille du monde; mais ce n'est que faute de reflexion que ces mille ecus vous tentent.
Au contraire, c'est par reflexion qu'ils me tentent; plus j'y reve, et plus je les trouve bons.
Mais vous aimez votre maitresse; et, si elle n'etoit pas heureuse avec cet homme-la, ne vous reprocheriez-vous pas d'y avoir contribue pour une miserable somme? Ma foi, vous avez beau dire: d'ailleurs, le Comte est un honnete homme, et je n'y entends point de finesse.
Voila Madame qui revient; elle a a vous parier.
Je me retire.
Meditez sur cette somme, vous la gouterez aussi bien que moi.
Je ne suis pas si fache de la tromper.
Vous avez donc vu ma mere? Oui, Madame; il n'y a qu'un moment.
Elle me l'a dit, et voudroit bien que j'en eusse pris un autre que vous.
Il me l'a paru.
Oui, mais ne vous embarrassez point, vous me convenez.
Je n'ai point d'autre ambition.
Parlons de ce que j'ai a vous dire; mais que ceci soit secret entre nous, je vous prie.
Je me trahirois plutot moi-meme.
Je n'hesite point non plus a vous donner ma confiance.
Voici ce que c'est: on veut me marier avec monsieur le Comte Dorimont, pour eviter un grand proces que nous aurions ensemble au sujet d'une terre que je possede.
Je le sais, Madame, et j'ai eu le malheur d'avoir deplu tout a l'heure la- dessus a madame Argante.
Eh! d'ou vient? C'est que, si, dans votre proces, vous avez le bon droit de votre cote, on souhaite que je vous dise le contraire, afin de vous engager plus vite a ce mariage: et j'ai prie qu'on m'en dispensat.
Que ma mere est frivole! Votre fidelite ne me surprend point; j'y comptois.
Faites toujours de meme, et ne vous choquez point de ce que ma mere vous a dit; je la desapprouve.
A-t-elle tenu quelque discours desagreable? Il n'importe, Madame; mon zele et mon attachement en augmentent, voila tout.
Et voila aussi pourquoi je ne veux pas qu'on vous chagrine, et que j'y mettrai bon ordre.
Qu'est-ce que cela signifie? Je me facherai, si cela continue.
Je loue vos sentiments.
Revenons a ce proces dont il est question: si je n'epouse point monsieur le Comte...
Madame la Marquise se porte mieux, Madame (il feint de voir Dorante avec surprise), et vous est fort obligee...
fort obligee de votre attention.
(Dorante feint de detourner la tete pour se cacher de Dubois.) Voila qui est bien.
DUBOIS, regardant toujours Dorante.
Madame, on m'a charge aussi de vous dire un mot qui presse.
De quoi s'agit-il? Il m'est recommande de ne vous parler qu'en particulier.
ARAMINTE, a Dorante.
Je n'ai point acheve ce que je voulois vous dire; laissez-moi, je vous prie, un moment, et revenez.
ARAMINTE, surprise.
Quoi! seulement pour avoir vu Dorante ici? Savez-vous a qui vous avez a faire? Au neveu de monsieur Remy, mon procureur.
Eh! par quel tour d'adresse est-il connu de Madame? Comment a-t-il fait pour arriver jusqu'ici? C'est monsieur Remy qui me l'a envoye pour intendant.
Lui votre intendant! Et c'est monsieur Remy qui vous l'envoie! Helas! le bonhomme, il ne sait pas qui il vous donne: c'est un demon que ce garcon- la.
Mais que signifient tes exclamations? Explique-toi: est-ce que tu le connois? Si je le connois, Madame! si je le connois! Ah! vraiment oui; et il me connoit bien aussi.
N'avez-vous pas vu comme il se detournoit, de peur que je ne le visse? Il est vrai, et tu me surprends a mon tour.
Seroit-il capable de quelque mauvaise action, que tu saches? Est-ce que ce n'est pas un honnete homme? Lui? il n'y a point de plus brave homme dans toute la terre; il a, peut- etre, plus d'honneur a lui tout seul que cinquante honnetes gens ensemble.
Oh! c'est une probite merveilleuse; il n'a peut-etre pas son pareil.
Eh! de quoi peut-il donc etre question? D'ou vient que tu m'alarmes? En verite, j'en suis toute emue.
Son defaut, c'est la.
(Il se touche le front.) C'est a la tete que le mal le tient.
A la tete? Oui, il est timbre; mais timbre comme cent.
Dorante! Il m'a paru de tres bon sens.
Otez cela, c'est un homme incomparable.
ARAMINTE, un peu boudant.
Oh bien! il sera, ce qu'il voudra, mais je ne le garderai pas: on a bien affaire d'un esprit renverse! et peut-etre encore, je gage, pour quelque objet qui n'en vaut pas la peine: car les hommes ont des fantaisies...
Ah! vous m'excuserez: pour ce qui est de l'objet, il n'y a rien a dire.
Malepeste! sa folie est de bon gout.
N'importe, je veux le congedier.
Est-ce que tu la connois, cette personne? J'ai l'honneur de la voir tous les jours: c'est vous, Madame.
Moi, dis-tu! Il vous adore; il y a six mois qu'il n'en vit point, qu'il donnerait sa vie pour avoir le plaisir de vous contempler un instant.
Vous avez du voir qu'il a l'air enchante quand il vous parle.
Il y a bien en effet quelque petite chose qui m'a paru extraordinaire.
Eh! juste Ciel! le pauvre garcon, de quoi s'avise-t-il? Vous ne croiriez pas jusqu'ou va sa demence; elle le ruine, elle lui coupe la gorge.
Il y en a une qui n'en sauroit revenir, et qui le poursuit encore tous les jours; je le sais, car je l'ai rencontree.
ARAMINTE, avec negligence.
Actuellement? Oui, Madame, actuellement: une grande brune tres piquante, et qu'il fuit.
Il n'y a pas moyen, Monsieur refuse tout.
"Je les tromperois, me disoit- il: je ne puis les aimer, mon coeur est parti "; ce qu'il disoit quelquefois la larme a l'oeil: car il sent bien son tort.
Cela est facheux.
Quelle aventure! J'eus beau lui crier: "Monsieur!" Point de nouvelles, il n'y avoit plus personne au logis.
A la fin.
pourtant, il revint a lui avec un air egare; je le jetai dans une voiture, et nous retournames a la maison.
J'esperois que cela se passeroit, car je l'aimois.
Tu m'etonnes a un point!...
Je me fis meme ami d'un de vos gens qui n'y est plus, un garcon fort exact, et qui m'instruisoit, et a qui je payois bouteille.
"C'est a la Comedie qu'on va"; me disoit-il et je courois faire mon rapport, sur lequel, des quatre heures, mon homme etoit a la porte.
Est-il possible? Oui, Madame.
A la fin, ce train de vie m'ennuya; ma sante s'alteroit, la sienne aussi.
Mon bonheur ensuite m'a mis chez Madame, ou, a force de se demener, je le trouve parvenu a votre intendance, ce qu'il ne troqueroit pas contre la place d'un empereur.
Y a-t-il rien de si particulier? Je suis si lasse d'avoir des gens qui me trompent que je me rejouissois de l'avoir, parce qu'il a de la probite: ce n'est pas que je sois fachee, car je suis bien au-dessus de cela.
Il y aura de la bonte a le renvoyer.
Plus il voit Madame, plus il s'acheve.
Vraiment, je le renverrai bien; mais ce n'est pas la ce qui le guerira.
D'ailleurs, je ne sais que dire a monsieur Remy, qui me l'a recommande, et ceci m'embarrasse.
Je ne vois pas trop comment m'en defaire honnetement.
Oui; mais vous en ferez un incurable, Madame.
ARAMINTE, vivement.
Oh! tant pis pour lui.
Oui, c'est un remede bien innocent.
Premierement, il ne vous dira mot; jamais vous n'entendrez parler de son amour.
En es-tu bien sur? Oh! il ne faut pas en avoir peur: il mourroit plutot.
Il a un respect, une adoration, une humilite pour vous, qui n'est pas concevable.
ARAMINTE, haussant les epaules, Voila qui est bien digne de compassion! Allons, je patienterai quelques jours, en attendant que j'en aie un autre.
Au surplus, ne crains rien, je suis contente de toi; je recompenserai ton zele, et je ne veux pas que tu me quittes, entends-tu, Dubois? Madame, je vous suis devoue pour la vie.
J'aurai soin de toi.
Surtout qu'il ne sache pas que je suis instruite; garde un profond secret, et que tout le monde, jusqu'a Marton, ignore ce que tu m'as dit: ce sont de ces choses qui ne doivent jamais percer.
Je n'en ai jamais parle qu'a Madame.
Le voici qui revient; va-t'en.
ARAMINTE, un moment seule.
La verite est que voici une confidence dont je me serois bien passee moi- meme.
Madame, je me rends a vos ordres.
Oui, Monsieur.
De quoi vous parlois-je? Je l'ai oublie.
D'un proces avec monsieur le Comte Dorimont.
Je me remets; je vous disois qu'on veut nous marier.
Oui, Madame, et vous alliez, je crois, ajouter que vous n'etiez pas portee a ce mariage.
Il est vrai.
J'avois envie de vous charger d'examiner l'affaire, afin de savoir si je ne risquerois rien a plaider; mais je crois devoir vous dispenser de ce travail: je ne suis pas sure de pouvoir vous garder.
Ah! Madame, vous avez eu la bonte de me rassurer la-dessus.
Oui; mais je ne faisois pas reflexion que j'ai promis a monsieur le Comte de prendre un intendant de sa main; vous voyez bien qu'il ne seroit pas honnete de lui manquer de parole, et, du moins, faut-il que je parle a celui qu'il m'amenera.
Je ne suis pas heureux, rien ne me reussit, et j'aurai la douleur d'etre renvoye.
ARAMINTE, par foiblesse.
Je ne dis pas cela; il n'y a rien de resolu la-dessus.
Ne me laissez point dans l'incertitude ou je suis, Madame.
Eh! mais oui, je tacherai que vous restiez; je tacherai.
Vous m'ordonnez donc de vous rendre compte de l'affaire en question? Attendons: si j'allois epouser le Comte, vous auriez pris une peine inutile.
Je croyois avoir entendu dire a Madame qu'elle n'avoit point de penchant pour lui.
Pas encore.
Et, d'ailleurs, votre situation est si tranquille et si douce! ARAMINTE, a part.
Je n'ai pas le courage de l'affliger!...
Eh bien, oui-da, examinez toujours, examinez.
J'ai des papiers dans mon cabinet, je vais les chercher.
Vous viendrez les prendre, et je vous les donnerai.
(En s'en allant.) Je n'oserois presque le regarder! DORANTE, DUBOIS, venant d'un air mysterieux et comme passant.
Marton vous cherche pour vous montrer l'appartement qu'on vous destine.
Arlequin est alle boire; j'ai dit que j'allois vous avertir.
Comment vous traite-t-on? Qu'elle est aimable! Je suis enchante! De quelle facon a-t-elle recu ce que tu lui as dit? DUBOIS, comme en fuyant.
Elle opine tout doucement a vous garder par compassion: elle espere vous guerir par l'habitude de la voir.
DORANTE, charme.
Sincerement? Elle n'en rechappera point; c'est autant de pris.
Je m'en retourne.
Reste, au contraire; je crois que voici Marton.
Dis-lui que Madame m'attend pour me remettre des papiers, et que j'irai la trouver des que je les aurai.
Partez: aussi bien ai-je un petit avis a donner a Marton.
Il est bon de jeter dans tous les esprits les soupcons dont nous avons besoin.
Ou est donc Dorante? Il me semble l'avoir vu avec toi? DUBOIS, brusquement.
Il dit que Madame l'attend pour des papiers, il reviendra ensuite.
Au reste, qu'est-il necessaire qu'il voie cet appartement? S'il n'en vouloit pas, il seroit bien delicat; pardi, je lui conseillerais...
Ce ne sont pas la tes affaires; je suis les ordres de Madame.
Madame est bonne et sage; mais prenez garde: ne trouvez-vous pas que ce petit galant-la fait les yeux doux? Il les fait comme il les a.
Je me trompe fort si je n'ai pas vu la mine de ce freluquet considerer, je ne sais ou, celle de Madame.
Eh bien! est-ce qu'on te fache quand on la trouve belle? Non.
Mais je me figure quelquefois qu'il n'est venu ici que pour la voir de plus pres.
MARTON, riant.
Ah! ah! quelle idee! Va, tu n'y entends rien; tu t'y connois mal.
DUBOIS, riant.
Ah! ah! je suis donc bien sot.
MARTON, riant en s'en allant.
Ah! ah! l'original avec ses observations! DUBOIS, seul.
Allez, allez, prenez toujours.
J'aurai soin de vous les faire trouver meilleures.
Allons faire jouer toutes nos batteries.
Non, Madame, vous ne risquez rien; vous pouvez plaider en toute surete.
J'ai meme consulte plusieurs personnes, l'affaire est excellente; et, si vous n'avez que le motif dont vous parlez pour epouser monsieur le Comte, rien ne vous oblige a ce mariage.
Je l'affligerai beaucoup, et j'ai de la peine a m'y resoudre.
Il ne seroit pas juste de vous sacrifier a la crainte de l'affliger.
Je ne saurois y trouver a redire; en tout cas, si je l'epouse, et qu'il veuille en mettre un autre ici a votre place, vous n'y perdrez point; je vous promets de vous en trouver une meilleure.
DORANTE, tristement.
Non, Madame, si j'ai le malheur de perdre celle-ci, je ne serai plus a personne; et apparemment que je la perdrai, je m'y attends.
Je crois pourtant que je plaiderai; nous verrons.
J'avois encore une petite chose a vous dire, Madame.
Je viens d'apprendre que le concierge d'un de vos terres est mort; on pourrait y mettre un de vos gens, et j'ai songe a Dubois, que je remplacerai ici par un domestique dont je reponds.
Non, envoyez plutot votre homme au chateau, et laissez-moi Dubois; c'est un garcon de confiance qui me sert bien, et que je veux garder.
A propos, il m'a dit, ce me semble, qu'il avoit ete a vous quelque temps? DORANTE, feignant un peu d'embarras.
Il est vrai, Madame; il est fidele, mais peu exact.
Rarement, au reste, ces gens-la parlent-ils bien de ceux qu'ils ont servis.
Ne me nuiroit-il point dans votre esprit? ARAMINTE, negligemment.
Celui-ci dit beaucoup de bien de vous, et voila tout.
Que me veut monsieur Remy? Madame, je suis votre tres humble serviteur.
Je viens vous remercier de la bonte que vous avez eue de prendre mon neveu a ma recommandation.
Je n'ai pas hesite, comme vous l'avez vu.
Je vous rends mille graces.
Ne m'aviez-vous pas dit qu'on vous en offroit un autre? Oui, Monsieur.
Tant mieux, car je viens vous demander celui-ci pour une affaire d'importance.
DORANTE, d'un air de refus.
Et d'ou vient, Monsieur? Patience! Mais, monsieur Remy, ceci est un peu vif; vous prenez assez mal votre temps, et j'ai refuse l'autre personne.
Pour moi, je ne sortirai jamais de chez Madame qu'elle ne me congedie.
Monsieur REMY, brusquement.
Vous ne savez ce que vous dites.
Il faut pourtant sortir; vous allez voir.
Cela est-il net? Y a-t-il a se consulter la-dessus? Dans deux heures il faut etre au logis.
Ai-je tort, Madame? ARAMINTE, froidement.
C'est a lui de repondre.
Eh bien! A quoi pense-t-il donc? Viendrez-vous? Non, Monsieur, je ne suis pas dans cette disposition-la.
Hum! Quoi? Entendez-vous ce que je vous dis, qu'elle a quinze mille livres de rente, entendez-vous? Oui, Monsieur; mais, en eut-elle vingt fois davantage, je ne l'epouserois pas; nous ne serions heureux ni l'un ni l'autre; j'ai le coeur pris; j'aime ailleurs.
Monsieur REMY, d'un ton railleur et trainant ses mots.
J'ai le coeur pris! voila qui est facheux! Ah! ah! le coeur est admirable! Je n'aurois jamais devine la beaute des scrupules de ce coeur-la, qui veut qu'on reste intendant de la maison d'autrui, pendant qu'on peut l'etre de la sienne.
Est-ce la votre dernier mot, berger fidele? Je ne saurois changer de sentiment, Monsieur.
Il paroit avoir tort, j'en conviens.
Monsieur REMY, vivement.
Comment! Madame, il pourroit...
Dans sa facon de penser je l'excuse.
Voyez pourtant, Dorante, tachez de vaincre votre penchant, si vous le pouvez; je sais bien que cela est difficile.
Il n'y a pas moyen.
Madame, mon amour m'est plus cher que ma vie.
Monsieur REMY, d'un air etonne.
Ceux qui aiment les beaux sentiments doivent etre contents; en voila un des plus curieux qui se fasse.
Vous trouvez donc cela raisonnable, Madame? Je vous laisse, parlez-lui vous-meme.
(A part.) Il me touche tant qu'il faut que je m'en aille.
(Elle sort.) Il ne croit pas si bien me servir.
Monsieur REMY, regardant son neveu.
Dorante, sais-tu bien qu'il n'y a point de fou aux petites-maisons de ta force? (Marton arrive.) Venez, Mademoiselle Marton.
Je viens d'apprendre que vous etiez ici.
Dites-nous un peu votre sentiment; que pensez-vous de quelqu'un qui n'a point de bien, et qui refuse d'epouser une honnete et fort jolie femme, avec quinze mille livres de rente bien venants? Votre question est bien aisee a decider: ce quelqu'un reve.
Monsieur REMY, montrant Dorante.
Assurement vous etes fort jolie, mais vous ne le disputerez point a un pareil etablissement: il n'y a point de beaux yeux qui vaillent ce prix-la.
Quoi! Monsieur Remy, c'est de Dorante dont vous parlez? C'est pour se garder a moi qu'il refuse d'etre riche? Tout juste, et vous etes trop genereuse pour le souffrir.
MARTON, avec un air de passion.
Vous vous trompez, Monsieur, je l'aime trop moi-meme pour l'en empecher, et je suis enchantee.
Ah! Dorante, que je vous estime! Je n'aurois pas cru que vous m'aimassiez tant.
Courage! je ne fais que vous le montrer, et vous en etes deja coiffee! Pardi! le coeur d'une femme est bien etonnant; le feu y prend bien vite.
MARTON, comme chagrine.
Eh! Monsieur, faut-il tant de bien pour etre heureux? Madame, qui a de la bonte pour moi, suppleera en partie, par sa generosite, a ce qu'il me sacrifie.
Vous me charmez: que de delicatesse! Il n'y a encore rien de si tendre que ce que vous me dites.
Par ma foi, je ne m'y connois donc guere, car je le trouve bien plat.
(A Marton.) Adieu, la belle enfant; je ne vous aurois, ma foi, pas evaluee ce qu'il vous achete.
Serviteur, idiot; garde ta tendresse, et moi ma succession.
(Il sort.) Il est en colere, mais nous l'apaiserons.
Je l'espere.
Quelqu'un vient.
C'est le Comte, celui dont je vous ai parle, et qui doit epouser Madame.
Je vous laisse donc; il pourroit me parler de son proces: vous savez ce que je vous ai dit la-dessus, et il est inutile que je le voie.
Bonjour, Marton.
Vous voila donc revenu, Monsieur? Oui.
Nous n'en devons rien craindre non plus, Monsieur.
Imaginez-vous qu'elle l'a querelle de ce qu'il etoit bien fait.
Ne seroit-ce point lui que je viens de voir sortir d'avec vous? Lui-meme.
Il a bonne mine, en effet, et n'a pas trop l'air de ce qu'il est.
Pardonnez-moi, Monsieur: car il est honnete homme.
N'y auroit-il pas moyen de raccommoder cela? Araminte ne me hait pas, je pense, mais elle est lente a se determiner, et, pour achever de la resoudre, il ne s'agiroit plus que de lui dire que le sujet de notre discussion est douteux pour elle.
Elle ne voudra pas soutenir l'embarras d'un proces.
Parlons a cet intendant; s'il ne faut que de l'argent pour le mettre dans nos interets, je ne l'epargnerai pas.
Oh! non; ce n'est point un homme a mener par la; c'est le garcon de France le plus desinteresse...
Tant pis! ces gens-la ne sont bons a rien.
Laissez-moi faire.
Mademoiselle, voila un homme qui en demande un autre; savez-vous qui c'est? MARTON, brusquement.
Et qui est cet autre? A quel homme en veut-il? Ma foi, je n'en sais rien; c'est de quoi je m'informe a vous.
Fais-le entrer.
ARLEQUIN, le faisant sortir des coulisses.
He! le garcon! venez ici dire votre affaire.
Je le connois de vue, mais je ne sais pas son nom.
N'est-ce pas vous, Monsieur le Comte? Non, surement.
Je n'ai point affaire a Monsieur, Mademoiselle, c'est une autre personne.
Et chez qui vous a-t-on dit que vous le trouveriez? Chez un procureur qui s'appelle monsieur Remy.
Ah! n'est-ce pas le procureur de Madame? Montrez-nous la boite.
Monsieur, cela m'est defendu; je n'ai ordre de la donner qu'a celui a qui elle est: le portrait de la dame est dedans.
Le portrait d'une dame! Qu'est-ce que cela signifie? Seroit-ce celui d'Araminte? Je vais tout a l'heure savoir ce qu'il en est.
Vous avez mal fait de parler de ce portrait devant lui.
Je sais qui vous cherchez; c'est le neveu de monsieur Remy, de chez qui vous venez.
Je le crois aussi, Mademoiselle.
Un grand homme qui s'appelle monsieur Dorante.
Il me semble que c'est son mon.
Il me l'a dit; je suis dans sa confidence.
Avez-vous remarque le portrait? Non, je n'ai pas pris garde a qui il ressemble.
Eh bien! c'est de moi dont il s'agit.
Monsieur Dorante n'est pas ici, et ne reviendra pas sitot.
Vous n'avez qu'a me remettre la boite; vous le pouvez en toute surete; vous lui ferez meme plaisir.
Vous voyez que je suis au fait.
C'est ce qui me paroit.
La voila, Mademoiselle.
Ayez donc, je vous prie, le soin de la lui rendre quand il sera revenu.
Oh! je n'y manquerai pas.
Il y a encore une bagatelle qu'il doit dessus, mais je tacherai de repasser tantot, et, s'il n'y etoit pas, vous auriez la bonte d'achever de payer.
Sans difficulte.
(A part.) Voici Dorante.
(Au garcon.) Retirez-vous vite.
MARTON, un moment seule et joyeuse.
Ce ne peut etre que mon portrait.
Le charmant homme! Monsieur Remy a raison de dire qu'il y avoit quelque temps qu'il me connoissoit.
Mademoiselle, n'avez-vous pas vu ici quelqu'un qui vient d'arriver? Arlequin croit que c'est moi qu'il demande.
MARTON, le regardant avec tendresse.
Que vous etes aimable, Dorante! Je serois bien injuste de ne vous pas aimer.
Allez, soyez en repos; l'ouvrier est venu, je lui ai parle, j'ai la boite, je la tiens.
J'ignore...
Point de mystere; je la tiens, vous dis-je, et je ne m'en fache pas.
Je vous la rendrai quand je l'aurai vue.
Retirez-vous, voici Madame avec sa mere et le Comte; c'est peut-etre de cela qu'ils s'entretiennent.
Laissez- moi les calmer la-dessus, et ne les attendez pas.
DORANTE, en s'en allant et riant.
Tout a reussi, elle prend le change a merveille.
Marton, qu'est-ce que c'est qu'un portrait dont monsieur le Comte me parle, qu'on vient d'apporter ici a quelqu'un qu'on ne nomme pas, et qu'on soupconne etre le mien? Instruisez-moi de cette histoire-la.
MARTON, d'un air reveur.
Ce n'est rien, Madame; je vous dirai ce que c'est: je l'ai demele apres que monsieur le Comte a ete parti; il n'a que faire de s'alarmer.
Il n'y a rien la qui vous interesse.
Comment le savez-vous, Mademoiselle? Vous n'avez point vu le portrait.
N'importe, c'est tout comme si je l'avois vu.
Je sais qui il regarde; n'en soyez point en peine.
Ce qu'il y a de certain, c'est un portrait de femme, et c'est ici qu'on vient chercher la personne qui l'a fait faire, a qui on doit le rendre, et ce n'est pas moi.
Mais quand je vous dis que Madame n'y est pour rien, ni vous non plus.
Eh bien! si vous etes instruite, dites-nous donc de quoi il est question, car je veux le savoir.
On a des idees qui ne me plaisent point.
Oui, ceci a un air de mystere qui est desagreable.
Il ne faut pourtant pas vous facher, ma fille: monsieur le Comte vous aime, et un peu de jalousie, meme injuste, ne messied pas a un amant.
Je ne suis jaloux que de l'inconnu qui ose se donner le plaisir d'avoir le portrait de Madame.
ARAMINTE, vivement.
Comme il vous plaira, Monsieur; mais j'ai entendu ce que vous vouliez dire, et je crains un peu ce caractere d'esprit-la.
Eh bien, Marton? Eh bien, Madame, voila bien du bruit! C'est mon portrait.
Votre portrait? Oui, le mien.
Eh! pourquoi non, s'il vous plait? Il ne faut pas tant se recrier.
Je suis assez comme monsieur le Comte; la chose me paroit singuliere.
Ma foi, Madame, sans vanite, on en peint tous les jours, et des plus huppees, qui ne me valent pas.
Et qui est-ce qui a fait cette depense-la pour vous? Un tres aimable homme qui m'aime, qui a de la delicatesse et des sentiments, et qui me recherche; et, puisqu'il faut vous le nommer, c'est Dorante.
Mon intendant? Lui-meme.
Le fat, avec ses sentiments! ARAMINTE, brusquement.
Eh! vous nous trompez; depuis qu'il est ici, a-t-il en le temps de vous faire peindre? Mais ce n'est pas d'aujourd'hui qu'il me connoit.
ARAMINTE, vivement.
Donnez donc.
Je n'ai pas encore ouvert la boite, mais c'est moi que vous y allez voir.
(Araminte l'ouvre, tous regardent).
Eh! je m'en doutois bien: c'est Madame.
Madame!...
Il est vrai, et me voila bien loin de mon compte! (A part.) Dubois avoit raison tantot.
ARAMINTE, a part.
Et moi, je vois clair.
(A Marton.) Par quel hasard avez-vous cru que c'etoit vous? Ma foi, Madame, toute autre que moi s'y seroit trompee.
Monsieur Remy me dit que son neveu m'aime, qu'il veut nous marier ensemble; Dorante est present, et ne dit point non; il refuse devant moi un tres riche parti; l'oncle s'en prend a moi, me dit que j'en suis cause.
Ensuite vient un homme qui apporte ce portrait, qui vient chercher ici celui a qui il appartient; je l'interroge: a tout ce qu'il repond, je reconnois Dorante.
C'est un petit portrait de femme, Dorante m'aime jusqu'a refuser sa fortune pour moi, je conclus donc que c'est moi qu'il a fait peindre.
Ai- je eu tort? J'ai pourtant mal conclu.
J'y renonce; tant d'honneur ne m'appartient point.
Je crois voir toute l'etendue de ma meprise, et je me tais.
Ah! ce n'est pas la une chose bien difficile a deviner.
Vous faites le fache, l'etonne, Monsieur le Comte; il y a eu quelque malentendu dans les mesures que vous avez prises; mais vous ne m'abusez point: c'est a vous qu'on apportait le portrait.
Un homme dont on ne sait pas le nom, qu'on vient chercher ici, c'est vous, Monsieur, c'est vous.
MARTON, d'un air serieux.
Je ne crois pas.
Oui, oui, c'est Monsieur; a quoi bon vous en defendre? Dans les termes ou vous en etes avec ma fille, ce n'est pas la un si grand crime; allons, convenez-en.
LE COMTE, froidement.
Non, Madame, ce n'est point moi, sur mon honneur; je ne connois pas ce monsieur Remy: comment auroit-on  dit chez lui qu'on auroit de mes nouvelles ici? Cela ne se peut pas.
ARGANTE, a'un air pensif.
Je ne faisois pas attention a cette circonstance.
Bon! qu'est-ce que c'est qu'une circonstance de plus ou de moins? Je n'en rabats rien.
Quoi qu'il en soit, je le garde, personne ne l'aura.
Mais quel bruit entendons-nous? Voyez ce que c'est, Marton.
ARAMINTE, LE COMTE, Mme.
ARGANTE, MARTON, DUBOIS, ARLEQUIN.
ARLEQUIN, en entrant.
Tu es un plaisant magot! A qui en avez-vous donc, vous autres? Si je disois un mot, ton maitre sortiroit bien vite.
Toi? Nous nous soucions de toi et de toute ta race de canaille comme de cela.
Comme je te batonnerois, sans le respect de Madame! Arrive, arrive: la voila, Madame.
Quel sujet avez-vous donc de quereller? De quoi s'agit-il? Mme.
Approchez, Dubois.
Apprenez-nous ce que c'est que ce mot que vous diriez contre Dorante; il seroit bon de savoir ce que c'est.
Prononce donc ce mot.
Tais-toi, laisse-le parler.
Il y a une heure qu'il me dit mille invectives, Madame.
Je soutiens les interets de mon maitre, je tire des gages pour cela, et je ne souffrirai pas qu'un ostrogoth menace mon maitre d'un mot; j'en demande justice a Madame.
Mais, encore une fois, sachons ce que veut dire Dubois par ce mot: c'est le plus presse.
Je lui defie d'en dire seulement une lettre.
C'est par pure colere que j'ai fait cette menace, Madame, et voici la cause de la dispute.
Voyez la malice! Ote- lui quelqu'autre meuble, s'il en a trop, mais laisse-lui cette piece, animal.
Et moi, je te dis qu'on ne la laissera point, que je la detacherai moi- meme, que tu en auras le dementi, et que Madame le voudra ainsi.
Eh! que m'importe? Il etoit bien necessaire de faire ce bruit-la pour un vieux tableau qu'on a mis la par hasard, et qui y est reste.
Cela vaut-il la peine qu'on en parle? Mme.
ARGANTE, d'un ton aigre.
Vous m'excuserez, ma fille: ce n'est point la sa place, et il n'y a qu'a l'oter; votre intendant se passera bien de ses contemplations.
ARAMINTE, souriant d'un air railleur.
Oh! vous avez raison: je ne pense pas qu'il les regrette.
(A Arlequin et a Dubois.) Retirez-vous tous deux.
ARAMINTE, LE COMTE, Mme.
ARGANTE, MARTON.
LE COMTE, d'un ton railleur.
Ce qui est de sur, c'est que cet homme d'affaires-la est de bon gout.
ARAMINTE, ironiquement.
Oui, la reflexion est juste.
Effectivement, il est fort extraordinaire qu'il ait jete les yeux sur ce tableau.
Cet homme-la ne m'a jamais plu un instant, ma fille; vous le savez, j'ai le coup d'oeil assez bon, et je ne l'aime pas.
Croyez-moi, vous avez entendu la menace que Dubois a faite en parlant de lui, j'y reviens encore, il faut qu'il ait quelque chose a en dire.
Interrogez-le; sachons ce que c'est, je suis persuadee que ce petit monsieur-la ne vous convient point; nous le voyons tous, il n'y a que vous qui n'y prenez pas garde.
MARTON, negligemment.
Pour moi, je n'en suis pas contente.
ARAMINTE, riant ironiquement.
Que vous etes aveugle! ARAMINTE, d'un air souriant.
Pas tant; chacun a ses lumieres, je consens, au reste, d'ecouter Dubois; le conseil est bon, et je l'approuve.
ARGANTE, vivement.
He bien! il vous deplaira; je ne vous en dis pas davantage, en attendant de plus fortes preuves.
Quant a moi, Madame, j'avoue que j'ai craint qu'il ne me servit mal aupres de vous, qu'il ne vous inspirat l'envie de plaider, et j'ai souhaite par pure tendresse qu'il vous en detournat.
Il aura pourtant beau faire, je declare que je renonce a tous proces avec vous, que je ne veux, pour arbitre de notre discussion, que vous et vos gens d'affaires, et que j'aime mieux perdre tout que de rien disputer.
ARGANTE, d'un ton decisif.
Mais ou seroit la dispute? Le mariage termineroit tout, et le votre est comme arrete.
Je garde le silence sur Dorante; je reviendrai simplement voir ce que vous pensez de lui, et, si vous le congediez, comme je le presume, il ne tiendra qu'a vous de prendre celui que je vous offrois, et que je retiendrai encore quelque temps.
Je ferai comme Monsieur, je ne vous parlerai plus de rien non plus: vous m'accuseriez de vision, et votre entetement finira sans notre secours.
Je compte beaucoup sur Dubois, que voici, et avec lequel nous vous laissons.
On m'a dit que vous vouliez me parler, Madame.
Viens ici: tu es bien imprudent, Dubois, bien indiscret; moi qui ai si bonne opinion de toi, tu n'as guere d'attention pour ce que je te dis.
ARAMINTE, d'un air vif.
J'ai bien senti que j'avois tort.
Passe encore pour la dispute; mais pourquoi s'ecrier: "Si je disois un mot?" Y a-t-il rien de plus mal a toi? C'est encore une suite de ce zele mal entendu.
Eh bien! tais-toi donc, tais-toi; je voudrais pouvoir te faire oublier ce que tu m'as dit.
Oh! je suis bien corrige.
C'est ton etourderie qui me force actuellement de te parler, sous pretexte de t'interroger sur ce que tu sais de lui.
A la bonne heure; mais il y aura un inconvenient s'il en est capable; on me dira de le renvoyer, et il n'est pas encore temps.
J'y ai pense depuis; la prudence ne le veut pas, et je suis obligee de prendre des biais, et d'aller tout doucement avec cette passion si excessive que tu dis qu'il a, et qui eclateroit peut-etre dans sa douleur.
Me fierois-je a un desespere? Ce n'est plus le besoin que j'ai de lui qui me retient, c'est moi que je menage.
(Elle radoucit le ton.) A moins que ce qu'a dit Marton ne soit vrai, auquel cas je n'aurois plus rien a craindre.
Elle pretend qu'il l'avoit deja vue chez monsieur Remy, et que le procureur a dit meme devant lui qu'il l'aimoit depuis longtemps, et qu'il falloit qu'ils se mariassent.
Je le voudrois.
ARAMINTE, negligemment.
Il t'a donc tout conte.
Oui, il n'y a qu'un moment, dans le jardin, ou il a voulu presque se jeter a mes genoux pour me conjurer de lui garder le secret sur sa passion, et d'oublier l'emportement qu'il eut avec moi quand je le quittai.
Je lui ai dit que je me tairois, mais que je ne pretendois pas rester dans la maison avec lui, et qu'il falloit qu'il sortit; ce qui l'a jete dans des gemissements, dans des pleurs, dans le plus triste etat du monde.
Eh! tant pis; ne le tourmente point; tu vois bien que j'ai raison de dire qu'il faut aller doucement avec cet esprit-la, fu le vois bien.
J'augurois beaucoup de ce mariage avec Marton; je croyois qu'il m'oublieroit; et point du tout, il n'est question de rien.
DUBOIS, comme s'en allant.
Pure fable.
Il est vrai qu'il me facherait s'il parloit; mais il seroit a propos qu'il me fachat.
Vraiment oui; monsieur Dorante n'est point digne de Madame.
S'il etoit dans une plus grande fortune, comme il n'y a rien a dire a ce qu'il est ne, ce seroit une autre affaire; mais il n'est riche qu'en merite, et ce n'est pas assez.
ARAMINTE, d'un ton comme triste.
Vraiment non, voila les usages; je ne sais pas comment je le traiterai; je n'en sais rien; je verrai.
Eh bien! Madame a un si beau pretexte...
Ce portrait que Marton a cru etre le sien, a ce qu'elle m'a dit.
Eh! non, je ne saurois l'en accuser: c'est le Comte qui l'a fait faire.
Point du tout, c'est de Dorante, je le sais de lui-meme, et il y travailloit encore il n'y a que deux mois, lorsque je le quittai.
Va-t'en; il y a longtemps que je te parle.
Si on me demande ce que tu m'as appris de lui, je dirai ce dont nous sommes convenus.
Le voici, j'ai envie de lui tendre un piege.
Oui, Madame, il se declarera peut-etre, et tout de suite je lui dirois: "Sortez." Laisse-nous.
DUBOIS, sortant, et en passant aupres de Dorante et rapidement.
Il m'est impossible de l'instruire; mais, qu'il se decouvre ou non, les choses ne peuvent aller que bien.
Tout le monde ici m'en veut, me persecute et conspire pour me faire sortir, j'en suis consterne; je tremble que vous ne cediez a leur inimitie pour moi, et j'en serois dans la derniere affliction.
ARAMINTE, d'un ton doux.
Tranquillisez-vous; vous ne dependez point de ceux qui vous en veulent; ils ne vous ont encore fait aucun tort dans mon esprit, et tous leurs petits complots n'aboutiront a rien: je suis la maitresse.
DORANTE, d'un air inquiet.
Je n'ai que votre appui, Madame.
Il ne vous manquera pas; mais je vous conseille une chose: ne leur paraissez pas si alarme, vous leur feriez douter de votre capacite, et il leur sembleroit que vous m'auriez beaucoup d'obligation de ce que je vous garde.
Ils ne se tromperaient pas, Madame; c'est une bonte qui me penetre de reconnoissance.
A la bonne heure; mais il n'est pas necessaire qu'ils le croient, je vous sais bon gre de votre attachement et de votre fidelite: niais dissimulez- en une partie, c'est peut-etre ce qui les indispose contre vous.
Vous leur avez refuse de m'en faire accroire sur le chapitre du proces; conformez-vous a ce qu'ils exigent; regagnez-les par la, je vous le permets; l'evenement leur persuadera que vous les avez bien servis, car, toute reflexion faite, je suis determinee a epouser le Comte.
DORANTE, d'un ton emu.
Determinee, Madame? Oui, tout a fait resolue: le Comte croira que vous y avez contribue; je le lui dirai meme, et je vous garantis que vous resterez ici; je vous le promets.
(A part.) Il change de couleur.
Quelle difference pour moi, Madame! ARAMINTE, d'un air delibere.
II n'y en aura aucune, ne vous embarrassez pas, et ecrivez le billet que je vais vous dicter; il y a tout ce qu'il faut sur cette table.
Eh! pour qui, Madame? Pour le Comte, qui est sorti d'ici extremement inquiet, et que je vais surprendre bien agreablement par le petit ot que vous allez lui ecrire en mon nom.
(Dorante reste reveur, et, par distraction, ne va point a la table.) Eh bien, vous n'allez pas a la table? A quoi revez-vous? DORANTE, toujours distrait.
Oui, Madame.
ARAMINTE, a part, pendant qu'il se place.
Il ne sait ce qu'il fait; voyons si cela continuera.
DORANTE cherche du papier.
Ah! Dubois m'a trompe! ARAMINTE poursuit.
Etes-vous pret a ecrire? Madame, je ne trouve point de papier.
ARAMINTE, allant elle-meme.
Vous n'en trouvez point! en voila devant vous.
Il est vrai.
Hatez-vous de venir, Monsieur, votre mariage est sur...
Avez- vous ecrit? Comment, Madame? Vous ne m'ecoutez donc pas? Votre mariage est sur; Madame veut que je vous l'ecrive, et vous attend pour vous le dire.
(A part.) Il souffre, mais il ne dit mot; est-ce qu'il ne parlera pas? N'attribuez point cette resolution a la crainte que Madame pourroit avoir des suites d'un proces douteux.
Je vous ai assure que vous le gagneriez, Madame: douteux, il ne l'est point.
N'importe, achevez.
Non, Monsieur, je suis charge de sa part de vous assurer que la seule justice qu'elle rend a votre merite la determine.
Ciel! je suis perdu.
Mais, Madame, vous n'aviez aucune inclination pour lui.
Achevez, vous dis-je.
Qu'elle rend a votre merite la determine...
je crois que la main vous tremble! vous paroissez change.
Qu'est-ce que cela signifie? Vous trouvez-vous mal? Je ne me trouve pas bien, Madame.
Quoi! si subitement! Cela est singulier.
Pliez la lettre et mettez: A Monsieur le Comte Dorimont.
Vous direz a Dubois qu'il la lui porte.
(A part.) Le coeur me bat! (A Dorante.) Voila qui est ecrit tout de travers! Cette adresse-la n'est presque pas lisible.
(A part.) Il n'y a pas encore la de quoi le convaincre.
DORANTE, a part.
Ne seroit-ce point aussi pour m'eprouver? Dubois ne m'a averti de rien.
Je suis bien aise, Madame, de trouver Monsieur ici; il vous confirmera tout de suite ce que j'ai a vous dire.
Vous avez offert en differentes occasions de me marier.
Madame, et jusqu'ici je ne me suis point trouvee disposee a profiter de vos bontes.
Ainsi, Monsieur, vous n'avez qu'a parler a Madame.
Si elle m'accorde a vous, vous n'aurez point de peine a m'obtenir de moi-meme.
(Elle sort.) DORANTE, ARAMlNTE.
ARAMINTE, a part, emue.
Cette folle! (Haut.) Je suis charmee de ce qu'elle vient de m'apprendre.
Vous avez fait la un tres bon choix: c'est une fille aimable et d'un excellent caractere.
DORANTE, d'un air abattu.
Helas! Madame, je ne songe point a elle.
Vous ne songez point a elle! Elle dit que vous l'aimez, que vous l'aviez vue avant que de venir ici.
DORANTE, tristement.
C'est une erreur ou monsieur Remy l'a jetee sans me consulter; et je n'ai point ose dire le contraire, dans la crainte de m'en faire une ennemie aupres de vous.
Il en est de meme de ce riche parti qu'elle croit que je refuse a cause d'elle, et je n'ai nulle part a tout cela.
Je suis hors d'etat de donner mon coeur a personne: je l'ai perdu pour jamais, et la plus brillante de toutes les fortunes ne me tenteroit pas.
Vous avez tort.
Il falloit desabuser Marton.
Elle vous auroit peut-etre empeche de me recevoir, et mon indifference lui en dit assez.
Mais, dans la situation ou vous etes, quel interet aviez-vous d'entrer dans ma maison, et de la preferer a une autre? Je trouve plus de douceur a etre chez vous, Madame.
Il y a quelque chose d'incomprehensible dans tout ceci! Voyez-vous souvent la personne que vous aimez? DORANTE, toujours abattu.
Pas souvent a mon gre, Madame; et je la verrois a tout instant que je ne croirois pas la voir assez.
ARAMINTE, a part.
Il a des expressions d'une tendresse! (Haut.) Est-elle fille? a-t-elle ete mariee? Madame, elle est veuve.
Et ne devez-vous pas l'epouser? Elle vous aime, sans doute? Helas! Madame, elle ne sait pas seulement que je l'adore.
Excusez l'emportement du terme dont je me sers.
Je ne saurois presque parier d'elle qu'avec transport! Je ne vous interroge que par etonnement.
Elle ignore que vous l'aimez, dites-vous? Et vous lui sacrifiez votre fortune? Voila de l'incroyable.
Comment, avec tant d'amour, avez-vous pu vous taire? On essaye de se faire aimer, ce me semble: cela est naturel et pardonnable.
Me preserve le Ciel d'oser concevoir la plus legere esperance! Etre aime, moi! Non, Madame.
Son etat est bien au-dessus du mien.
Mon respect me condamne au silence, et je mourrai du moins sans avoir eu le malheur de lui deplaire.
Je n'imagine point de femme qui merite d'inspirer une passion si etonnante; je n'en imagine point.
Elle est donc au-dessus de toute comparaison? Dispensez-moi de la louer, Madame: je m'egarerois en la peignant.
On ne connoit rien de si beau ni de si aimable qu'elle, et jamais elle ne me parle, ou ne me regarde, que mon amour n'en augmente.
ARAMINTE, baisse les yeux, et continue.
Mais votre conduite blesse la raison.
Que pretendez-vous avec cet amour pour une personne qui ne saura jamais que vous l'aimez? Cela est bien bizarre.
Que pretendez-vous? Le plaisir de la voir quelquefois, et d'etre avec elle, est tout ce que je me propose.
Avec elle? Oubliez-vous que vous etes ici? Je veux dire avec son portrait, quand je ne la vois point.
Son portrait! Est-ce que vous l'avez fait faire? Non, Madame; mais j'ai, par amusement, appris a peindre, et je l'ai peinte moi-meme.
Je me serois prive de son portrait si je n'avois pu l'avoir que par le secours d'un autre.
ARAMINTE, a part.
Il faut le pousser a bout.
(Haut.) Montrez-moi ce portrait.
Daignez m'en dispenser, Madame; quoique mon amour soit sans esperance, je n'en dois pas moins un secret inviolable a l'objet aime.
Il m'en est tombe un par hasard entre les mains: on l'a trouve ici.
(Montrant la boite.) Voyez si ce ne seroit point celui dont il s'agit.
Cela ne se peut pas.
ARAMINTE, ouvrant la boite.
Il est vrai que la chose seroit assez extraordinaire: examinez.
Ah! Madame, songez que j'aurois perdu mille fois la vie avant que d'avouer ce que le hasard vous decouvre.
Comment pourrai-je expier..
(Il se jette a ses genoux.) Dorante, je ne me facherai point.
Votre egarement me fait pitie.
Revenez- en, je vous le pardonne.
MARTON paroit, et s'enfuit.
Ah! (Dorante se leve vite.) Ah Ciel! c'est Marton! Elle vous a vu.
DORANTE, feignant d'etre deconcerte.
Non, Madame, non, je ne crois pas; elle n'est point entree.
Elle vous a vu, vous dis-je.
Laissez-moi, allez-vous en: vous m'etes insupportable.
Rendez-moi ma lettre.
(Quand il est parti.) Voila pourtant ce que c'est que de l'avoir garde! Dorante s'est-il declare, Madame, et est-il necessaire que je lui parle? Non, il ne m'a rien dit.
Je n'ai rien vu d'approchant a ce que tu m'as conte, et qu'il n'en soit plus question, ne t'en mele plus.
(Elle sort.) Voici l'affaire dans sa crise! Ah! Dubois.
Je ne sais qu'augurer de la conversation que je viens d'avoir avec elle.
A quoi songez-vous? Elle n'est qu'a deux pas: voulez-vous tout perdre? Il faut que tu m'eclaircisses...
Allez dans le jardin.
D'un doute...
Dans le jardin, vous dis-je; je vais m'y rendre.
Mais...
Je ne vous ecoute plus.
Je crains plus que jamais.
Non, vous dis-je; ne perdons point de temps.
La lettre est-elle prete? DORANTE, la lui montrant.
Oui, la voila, et j'ai mis dessus: "Rue du Figuier." Vous etes bien assure qu'Arlequin ne sait pas ce quartier-la? Il m'a dit que non.
Lui avez-vous bien recommande de s'adresser a Marton ou a moi pour savoir ce que c'est? Sans doute, et je lui recommanderai encore.
Allez donc la lui donner; je me charge du reste aupres de Marton, que je vais trouver.
Je t'avoue que j'hesite un peu.
N'allons-nous pas trop vite avec Araminte? Dans l'agitation des mouvements ou elle est, veux-tu encore lui donner l'embarras de voir subitement eclater l'aventure? Oh! oui, point de quartier.
Il faut l'achever, pendant qu'elle est etourdie.
Elle ne sait plus ce qu'elle fait.
Vous repentez-vous de l'effet qu'elle a produit? Monsieur a souffert! Parbleu! il me semble que cette aventure-ci merite un peu d'inquietude.
Sais-tu bien ce qui arrivera? Qu'elle prendra son parti, et qu'elle me renverra tout d'un coup.
Je lui en defie.
Il est trop tard; l'heure du courage est passee; il faut qu'elle nous epouse.
Prends-y garde: tu vois que sa mere la fatigue.
Je serois bien fache qu'elle la laissat en repos.
Elle est confuse de ce que Marton m'a surpris a ses genoux.
Ah! vraiment, des confusions! Elle n'y est pas.
Elle va en essuyer bien d'autres! C'est moi qui, voyant le train que prenoit la conversation, ai fait venir Marton une seconde fois.
Araminte pourtant m'a dit que je lui etois insupportable.
Elle a raison.
Voulez-vous qu'elle soit de bonne humeur avec un homme qu'il faut qu'elle aime en depit d'elle? Cela est-il agreable? Vous vous emparez de son bien, de son coeur; et cette femme ne criera pas? Allez, vite, plus de raisonnement; laissez-vous conduire.
Songe que je l'aime, et que, si notre precipitation reussit mal, tu me desesperes.
Ah! oui, je sais bien que vous l'aimez: c'est a cause de cela que je ne vous ecoute pas.
Etes-vous en etat de juger de rien? Allons, allons, vous vous moquez.
Laissez faire un homme de sang-froid.
Partez, d'autant plus que voici Marton qui vient a propos, et que je vais tacher d'amuser, en attendant que vous envoyiez Arlequin.
MARTON, d'un air triste.
Je te cherchois.
Qu'y a-t-il pour votre service.
Mademoiselle? Tu me l'avois bien dit, Dubois.
Quoi donc? Je ne me souviens plus de ce que c'est.
Que cet intendant osoit lever les yeux sur Madame.
Ah! oui: vous parlez de ce regard que je lui vis jeter sur elle.
Oh! jamais je ne l'ai oublie.
Cette oeillade-la ne valoit rien.
Il y avoit quelque chose dedans qui n'etoit pas dans l'ordre.
Oh! ca, Dubois, il s'agit de faire sortir cet homme-ci.
Pardi! tant qu'on voudra; je ne m'y epargne pas.
J'ai deja dit a Madame qu'on m'avoit assure qu'il n'entendoit pas les affaires.
Mais est-ce la tout ce que tu sais de lui? C'est de la part de madame Argante et de monsieur le Comte que je te parle, et nous avons peur que tu n'aies pas tout dit a Madame, ou qu'elle ne cache ce que c'est.
Ne nous deguise rien, tu n'en seras pas fache.
Ma foi! je ne sais que son insuffisance, dont j'ai instruit Madame.
Ne dissimule point.
Moi un dissimule! Moi garder un secret! Vous avez bien trouve votre homme! En fait de discretion, je meriterais d'etre femme.
Je vous demande pardon de la comparaison, mais c'est pour vous mettre l'esprit en repos.
Il est certain qu'il aime Madame.
Il n'en faut point douter: je lui en ai meme dit ma pensee a elle.
Et qu'a-t-elle repondu? Que j'etois un sot.
Elle est si prevenue...
Prevenue a un point que je n'oserois le dire, Dubois.
Oh! le diable n'y perd rien, ni moi mon plus: car je vous entends.
Tu as la mine d'en savoir plus que moi la-dessus.
Oh! point du tout, je vous jure.
Mais, a propos, il vient tout a l'heure d'appeller Arlequin pour lui donner une lettre; si nous pouvions la saisir, peut-etre en saurions-nous davantage.
Une lettre, oui-da: ne negligeons rien, Je vais de ce pas parler a Arlequin, s'il n'est pas encore parti.
Vous n'irez pas loin; je crois qu'il vient.
ARLEQUIN, voyant Dubois.
Ah! te voila donc, mal bati? Tenez: n'est-ce pas la une belle figure pour se moquer de la mienne? Que veux-tu, Arlequin? Ne sauriez-vous pas ou demeure la rue du Figuier, Mademoiselle? Oui.
J'aimerois mieux que le diable eut emporte toutes les rues que d'en savoir une par le moyen d'un malotru comme lui.
DUBOIS, a Marton, a part.
Prenez la lettre.
(Haut.) Non, non, Mademoiselle, ne lui enseignez rien; qu'il galope.
Veux-tu te taire? MARTON, negligemment.
Ne l'interrompez donc point, Dubois.
Eh bien! veux-tu me donner ta lettre? Je vais envoyer dans ce quartier-la, et on la rendra a son adresse.
Ah! voila qui est bien agreable! Vous etes une fille de bonne amitie, Mademoiselle.
DUBOIS, s'en allant.
Vous etes bien bonne d'epargner de la peine a ce faineant-la.
Ce malhonnete! Va, va trouver le tableau, pour voir comme il se moque de toi.
MARTON, seule avec Arlequin.
Ne lui reponds rien; donne ta lettre.
Tenez, Mademoiselle; vous me rendrez un service qui me fait grand bien.
Quand il y aura a trotter pour votre serviable personne, n'ayez point d'autre postillon que moi.
Elle sera rendue exactement.
Oui, je vous recommande l'exactitude, a cause de monsieur Dorante, qui merite toutes sortes de fidelites.
MARTON, a part.
L'indigne! ARLEQUIN, s'en allant.
Je suis votre serviteur eternel.
ARLEQUIN, revenant.
Si vous le rencontrez, ne lui dites point qu'un autre galope a ma place.
ARGANTE, LE COMTE, MARTON.
MARTON, un moment seule.
Ne disons mot que je n'aie vu ce que ceci contient.
Eh bien! Marton, qu'avez-vous appris de Dubois? Rien que ce que vous saviez deja, Madame, et ce n'est pas assez.
Dubois est un coquin qui nous trompe.
Il est vrai que sa menace paroissoit signifier quelque chose de plus.
Quoi qu'il en soit, j'attends monsieur Remy, que j'ai envoye chercher; et, s'il ne nous defait pas de cet homme-la, ma fille saura qu'il ose l'aimer, je l'ai resolu.
Nous en avons les presomptions les plus fortes, et, ne fut-ce que par bienseance, il faudra bien qu'elle le chasse.
D'un autre cote, j'ai fait venir l'intendant que monsieur le Comte lui proposoit.
Il est ici, et je le lui presenterai sur le champ.
Je doute que vous reussissiez, si nous n'apprenons rien de nouveau; mais je tiens peut-etre son conge, moi qui vous parle...
Voici monsieur Remy: je n'ai pas le temps de vous en dire davantage, et je vais m'eclaircir.
(Elle veut sortir.) Monsieur REMY, Mme.
ARGANTE, LE COMTE, MARTON.
Monsieur REMY, a Marton, qui se retire.
Bonjour, ma niece, puisqu'enfin il faut que vous la soyez.
Savez-vous ce qu'on me veut ici? MARTON, brusquement.
Passez, Monsieur, et cherchez votre niece ailleurs; je n'aime point les mauvais plaisants.
(Elle sort.) Voila une petite fille bien incivile? (A madame Argante.) On m'a dit de votre part de venir ici, Madame: de quoi est-il donc question? Mme.
ARGANTE, d'un ton reveche.
Ah! c'est donc vous, monsieur le procureur? Oui, Madame, je vous garantis que c'est moi-meme.
Et de quoi vous etes-vous avise, je vous prie, de nous embarrasser d'un intendant de votre facon? Et par quel hasard Madame y trouve-t-elle a redire? Mme.
C'est que nous nous serions bien passes du present que vous nous avez fait.
Ma foi, Madame, s'il n'est pas a votre gout, vous etes bien difficile.
C'est votre neveu, dit-on? Oui, Madame.
Eh bien! tout votre neveu qu'il est, vous nous ferez un grand plaisir de le retirer.
Ce n'est pas a vous que je l'ai donne.
Non, mais c'est a nous qu'il deplait, a moi et a monsieur le Comte que voila, et qui doit epouser ma fille.
Monsieur REMY, elevant la voix.
Celui-ci est nouveau! Mais, Madame, des qu'il n'est pas a vous, il me semble qu'il n'est pas essentiel qu'il vous plaise.
On n'a pas mis dans le marche qu'il vous plairoit, personne n'a songe a cela; et, pourvu qu'il convienne a madame Araminte, tout doit etre content; tant pis pour qui ne l'est pas.
Qu'est-ce que cela signifie? Mme.
Mais vous avez le ton bien rogue, Monsieur Remy.
Ma foi, vos compliments ne sont point propres a l'adoucir, Madame Argante.
Doucement, monsieur le procureur, doucement; il me paroit que vous avez tort.
Comme vous voudrez, monsieur le Comte, comme vous voudrez; mais cela ne vous regarde pas.
Vous savez bien que je n'ai pas l'honneur de vous connoitre, et nous n'avons que faire ensemble, pas la moindre chose.
Que vous me connoissiez ou non; il n'est pas si peu essentiel que vous le dites que votre neveu plaise a Madame.
Elle n'est pas une etrangere dans la maison.
Parfaitement etrangere pour cette affaire-ci, Monsieur; on ne peut pas plus etrangere; au surplus, Dorante est un homme d'honneur, connu pour tel, dont j'ai repondu, dont je repondrai toujours, et dont Madame parle ici d'une maniere choquante.
Votre Dorante est un impertinent.
Bagatelle! ce mot-la ne signifie rien dans votre bouche.
Dans ma bouche! A qui parle donc ce petit praticien, monsieur le Comte? Est-ce que vous ne lui imposerez pas silence? Comment donc! m'imposer silence, a moi, procureur! Savez-vous bien qu'il y a cinquante ans que je parle, madame Argante? Mme.
Il y a donc cinquante ans que vous ne savez ce que vous dites.
Qu'y a-t-il donc? On diroit que vous vous querellez.
Nous ne sommes pas fort en paix, et vous venez tres a propos, Madame: il s'agit de Dorante: avez-vous sujet de vous plaindre de lui? Non, que je sache.
Vous etes-vous apercue qu'il ait manque de probite? Lui? non vraiment.
Je ne le connois que pour un homme tres estimable.
ARAMINTE, froidement.
On se jette la dans de grands exces.
Je n'y ai point de part, Monsieur.
Je suis bien eloignee de vous traiter si mal.
A l'egard de Dorante, la meilleure justification qu'il y ait pour lui, c'est que je le garde.
Mais je venois pour savoir une chose, monsieur le Comte.
Il y a la-bas, m'a-t- on dit, un homme d'affaires que vous avez amene pour moi: on se trompe apparemment? Madame, il est vrai qu'il est venu avec moi; mais c'est madame Argante...
Attendez, je vais repondre.
Oui, ma fille, c'est moi qui ai prie Monsieur de le faire venir pour remplacer celui que vous avez, et que vous allez mettre dehors: je suis sure de mon fait.
J'ai laisse dire votre procureur, au reste; mais il amplifie.
Courage! Mme.
ARGANTE, vivement.
Paix! vous avez assez parle.
(A Araminte.) Je n'ai point dit que son neveu fut un fripon.
Il ne seroit pas impossible qu'il le fut; je n'en serois pas etonnee.
Mauvaise parenthese, avec votre permission, supposition injurieuse, et tout a fait hors d'oeuvre.
Honnete homme, soit; du moins n'a-t-on pas encore de preuve du contraire, et je veux croire qu'il l'est.
Pour un impertinent, et tres impertinent, j'ai dit qu'il en etoit un, et j'ai raison.
Vous dites que vous le garderez: vous n'en ferez rien.
ARAMINTE, froidement.
Il restera, je vous assure.
Point du tout; vous ne sauriez.
Seriez-vous d'humeur a garder un intendant qui vous aime? Eh! a qui voulez-vous donc qu'il s'attache? A vous, a qui il n'a pas affaire? Mais, en effet, pourquoi faut-il que mon intendant me haisse? Mme.
Eh! non, point d'equivoque.
Quand je vous dis qu'il vous aime, j'entends qu'il est amoureux de vous, en bon francois; qu'il est ce qu'on appelle amoureux; qu'il soupire pour vous; que vous etes l'objet secret de sa tendresse.
Dorante? ARAMINTE, riant.
L'objet secret de sa tendresse! Oh! oui, tres secret, je pense.
Ah! ah! je ne me croyois pas si dangereuse a voir.
Mais, des que vous devinez de pareils secrets, que ne devinez-vous que tous mes gens sont comme lui? Peut-etre qu'ils m'aiment aussi: que sait-on? Monsieur Remy, vous qui me voyez assez souvent, j'ai envie de deviner que vous m'aimez aussi.
Ma foi, Madame, a l'age de mon neveu, je ne m'en tirerois pas mieux qu'on dit qu'il s'en tire.
Ceci n'est pas matiere a plaisanterie, ma fille.
Il n'est pas question de votre monsieur Remy; laissons-la ce bonhomme, et traitons la chose un peu plus serieusement.
Vos gens ne vous font pas peindre, vos gens ne se mettent point a contempler vos portraits, vos gens n'ont point l'air galant, la mine doucereuse.
Monsieur REMY, a Araminte.
J'ai laisse passer le "bonhomme" a cause de vous, au moins; mais le "bonhomme" est quelquefois brutal.
En verite, ma mere, vous seriez la premiere a vous moquer de moi si ce que vous me dites me faisoit la moindre impression; ce seroit une enfance a moi que de le renvoyer sur un pareil soupcon.
Est-ce qu'on ne peut me voir sans m'aimer? Je n'y saurois que faire; il faut bien m'y accoutumer, et prendre mon parti la-dessus.
Vous lui trouvez l'air galant, dites-vous? Je n'y avois pas pris garde, et je ne lui en ferai point un reproche.
Il y auroit de la bizarrerie a se facher de ce qu'il est bien fait.
Je suis d'ailleurs comme tout le monde: j'aime assez les gens de bonne mine.
ARAMINTE, Mme.
ARGANTE, Monsieur REMY, LE COMTE, DORANTE.
Je vous demande pardon, Madame, si je vous interromps.
J'ai lieu de presumer que mes services ne vous sont plus agreables, et, dans la conjoncture presente, il est naturel que je sache mon sort.
ARGANTE, ironiquement.
Son sort! Le sort d'un intendant: que cela est beau! Et pourquoi n'auroit-il pas un sort? ARAMINTE, d'un air vif, a sa mere.
Voila des emportements qui m'appartiennent.
(A Dorante.) Quelle est cette conjoncture, Monsieur, et le motif de votre inquietude? Vous le savez, Madame.
Il y a quelqu'un ici que vous avez envoye chercher pour occuper ma place.
Ce quelqu'un-la est fort mal conseille.
Desabusez-vous: ce n'est point moi qui l'ai fait venir.
Tout a contribue a me tromper, d'autant plus que mademoiselle Marton vient de m'assurer que dans une heure je ne serois plus ici.
Marton vous a tenu un fort sot discours.
Le terme est encore trop long: il devroit en sortir tout a l'heure.
Monsieur REMY, comme a part.
Voyons par ou cela finira.
ARAMINTE, Mme.
ARGANTE, Monsieur REMY, LE COMTE, DORANTE, MARTON.
MARTON, froidement.
Ne vous pressez pas de le renvoyer.
Madame; voila une lettre de recommandation pour lui, et c'est monsieur Dorante qui l'a ecrite.
Comment! MARTON, donnant la lettre au Comte.
Un instant, Madame, cela merite d'etre ecoute; la lettre est de Monsieur, vous dis-je.
LE COMTE lit haut.
De la passion, entendez-vous, ma fille? LE COMTE lit.
Un miserable ouvrier que je n'attendois pas est venu ici m'apporter la boite de ce portrait que j'ai fait d'elle.
C'est-a-dire que le personnage sait peindre.
LE COMTE lit.
J'etois absent, il l'a laissee a une fille de la maison.
ARGANTE, a Marton.
Fille de la maison, cela vous regarde.
LE COMTE lit.
On a soupconne que ce portrait m'appartenoit: ainsi je pense qu'on va tout decouvrir, et qu'avec le chagrin d'etre renvoye et de perdre le plaisir de voir tous les jours celle que j'adore...
Que j'adore! ah! que j'adore! LE COMTE lit.
J'aurai encore celui d'etre meprise d'elle.
Je crois qu'il n'a pas mal devine celui-la, ma fille.
LE COMTE lit.
Non pas a cause de la mediocrite de ma fortune, sorte de mepris dont je n'oserois la croire capable...
Eh! pourquoi non? LE COMTE lit.
Mais seulement a cause du peu que je vaux aupres d'elle, tout honore que je suis de l'estime de tant d'honnetes gens.
Et en vertu de quoi l'estiment-ils tant? LE COMTE lit.
Auquel cas je n'ai plus que faire a Paris.
Vous etes a la veille de vous embarquer, et je suis determine a vous suivre.
Bon voyage au galant.
Le beau motif d'embarquement! Mme.
He bien! en avez-vous le coeur net, ma fille? L'eclaircissement m'en paroit complet.
ARAMINTE, a Dorante.
Quoi! cette lettre n'est pas d'une ecriture contrefaite? Vous ne la niez point? Madame...
Eh bien! quoi? c'est de l'amour qu'il a; ce n'est pas d'aujourd'hui que les belles personnes en donnent, et, tel que vous le voyez, il n'en a pas pris pour toutes celles qui auroient bien voulu lui en donner.
Cet amour- la lui coute quinze mille livres de rente, sans compter les mers qu'il veut courir; voila le mal: car, au reste, s'il etoit riche, le personnage en vaudroit bien un autre; il pourroit bien dire qu'il adore.
(Contrefaisant madame Argante.) Et cela ne seroit point si ridicule.
Accommodez-vous; au reste, je suis votre serviteur, Madame.
(Il sort.) Fera-t-on monter l'intendant que monsieur le Comte a amene, Madame? N'entendrai-je parler que d'intendant? Allez-vous en, vous prenez mal votre temps pour me faire des questions.
(Marton sort.) Mme.
Mais, ma fille, elle a raison; c'est monsieur le Comte qui vous en repond, il n'y a qu'a le prendre.
Et moi je n'en veux point.
Est-ce a cause qu'il vient de ma part, Madame? Vous etes le maitre d'interpreter, Monsieur; mais je n'en veux point.
Vous vous expliquez la-dessus d'un air de vivacite qui m'etonne.
Mais en effet, je ne vous reconnois pas.
Qu'est-ce qui vous fache? Tout: on s'y est mal pris; il y a dans tout ceci des facons si desagreables, des moyens si offensants, que tout m'en choque.
ARGANTE, etonnee.
On ne vous entend point.
Quoique je n'aie aucune part a ce qui vient de se passer, je ne m'apercois que trop, Madame, que je ne suis pas exempt de votre mauvaise humeur, et je serois fache d'y contribuer davantage par ma presence.
Non, Monsieur, je vous suis.
Ma fille, je retiens monsieur le Comte; vous allez venir nous trouver apparemment.
Vous n'y songez pas, Araminte, on ne sait que penser.
Enfin, Madame, a ce que je vois, vous en voila delivree: qu'il devienne tout ce qu'il voudra a present, tout le monde a ete temoin de sa folie, et vous n'avez plus rien a craindre de sa douleur; il ne dit mot.
Au reste, je viens seulement de le rencontrer, plus mort que vif, qui traversoit la galerie pour aller chez lui.
Vous auriez trop ri de le voir soupirer; il m'a pourtant fait pitie: je l'ai vu si defait, si pale et si triste, que j'ai eu peur qu'il ne se trouve mal.
ARAMINTE, qui ne l'a pas regarde jusque-la, et qui a toujours reve, dit d'un ton haut.
ARAMINTE, sechement.
Ne vous embarrassez pas, ce sont mes affaires.
En un mot, vous en etes quitte, et cela par le moyen de cette lettre qu'on vous a lue, et que mademoiselle Marton a tiree d'Arlequin par mon avis.
Je me suis doute qu'elle pourrait vous etre utile, et c'est une excellente idee que j'ai eue la, n'est-ce pas, Madame? ARAMINTE, froidement.
Quoi! c'est a vous que j'ai l'obligation de la scene qui vient de se passer? DUBOIS, librement.
Oui, Madame.
Mechant valet, ne vous presentez plus devant moi.
DUBOIS, comme etonne.
Helas! Madame, j'ai cru bien faire.
Allez, malheureux! Il falloit m'obeir; je vous avois dit de ne plus vous en meler: vous m'avez jetee dans tous les desagrements que je voulois eviter.
C'est vous qui avez repandu tous les soupcons qu'on a eus sur son compte, et ce n'est pas par attachement pour moi que vous m'avez appris qu'il m'aimoit: ce n'est que par le plaisir de faire du mal.
Vous l'assassinez, vous me trahissez moi-meme: il faut que vous soyez capable de tout.
Que je ne vous voie jamais, et point de replique.
DUBOIS, s'en va en riant.
Allons, voila qui est parfait.
MARTON, triste.
La maniere dont vous m'avez renvoyee il n'y a qu'un moment me montre que je vous suis desagreable, Madame, et je crois vous faire plaisir en vous demandant mon conge.
ARAMINTE, froidement.
Je vous le donne.
Votre intention est-elle que je sorte des aujourd'hui, Madame? Comme vous voudrez.
Cette aventure-ci est bien triste pour moi! Oh! point d'explication, s'il vous plait.
Je suis au desespoir! ARAMINTE, avec impatience.
Est-ce que vous etes fachee de vous en aller? Eh bien! restez, Mademoiselle, restez: j'y consens; mais finissons.
Elle est dans votre imagination.
Vous me demandez votre conge, je vous le donne.
Ah! Madame, pourquoi m'avez-vous exposee au malheur de vous deplaire? J'ai persecute par ignorance l'homme du monde le plus aimable, qui vous aime plus qu'on n'a jamais aime.
ARAMINTE, a part.
Et a qui je n'ai rien a reprocher: car il vient de me parler.
J'etois son ennemie, et je ne la suis plus.
Il m'a tout dit.
Il ne m'avoit jamais vue: c'est monsieur Remy qui m'a trompee, et j'excuse Dorante.
A la bonne heure.
Pourquoi avez-vous eu la cruaute de m'abandonner au hasard d'aimer un homme qui n'est pas fait pour moi, qui est digne de vous, et que j'ai jete dans une douleur dont je suis penetree.
ARAMINTE, d'un ton doux.
Tu l'aimois donc, Marton? Laissons la mes sentiments.
Rendez-moi votre amitie comme je l'avois, et je serai contente.
Ah! je te la rends toute entiere.
MARTON, lui baisant la main.
Me voila consolee.
Non, Marton, tu ne l'es pas encore.
Tu pleures, et tu m'attendris.
N'y prenez point garde.
Rien ne m'est si cher que vous! Va, je pretends bien te faire oublier tous tes chagrins.
Je pense que voici Arlequin.
Que veux-tu? ARLEQUIN, pleurant et sanglotant.
J'aurois bien de la peine a vous le dire, car je suis dans une detresse qui me coupe entierement la parole, a cause de la trahison que mademoiselle Marton m'a faite.
Ah! quelle ingrate perfidie! Laisse la ta perfidie, et nous dis ce que tu veux.
Ah! cette pauvre lettre! Quelle escroquerie! Dis donc.
Monsieur Dorante vous demande a genoux qu'il vienne ici vous rendre compte des paperasses qu'il a eues dans les mains depuis qu'il est ici.
Il m'attend a la porte, ou il pleure.
Dis-lui qu'il vienne.
Le voulez-vous, Madame? car je ne me fie pas a elle.
Quand on m'a une fois affronte je n'en reviens point.
MARTON, d'un air triste et attendri.
Parlez-lui, Madame; je vous laisse, ARLEQUIN, quand Marton est partie.
Vous ne me repondez point.
Il peut venir.
(Arlequin sort.) Approchez, Dorante.
Je n'ose presque paroitre devant vous.
ARAMINTE, a part.
Ah! je n'ai guere plus d'assurance que lui.
(Haut.) Pourquoi vouloir me rendre compte de mes papiers? Je m'en fie bien a vous.
Ce n'est pas la- dessus que j'aurai a me plaindre.
Madame...
j'ai autre chose a dire...
Je suis si interdit, si tremblant, que je ne saurais parler.
ARAMINTE, a part, avec emotion.
Ah! que je crains la fin de tout ceci! DORANTE, emu.
Un de vos fermiers est venu tantot, Madame.
ARAMINTE, emue.
Un de mes fermiers!...
Cela se peut.
Oui, Madame...
il est venu.
ARAMINTE, toujours emue.
Je n'en doute pas.
DORANTE, emu.
Et j'ai de l'argent a vous remettre.
Ah! de l'argent!...
Nous verrons.
Quand il vous plaira, Madame, de le recevoir.
Oui...
je le recevrai...
vous me le donnerez.
(A part.) Je ne sais ce que je lui reponds.
Ne seroit-il pas temps de vous l'apporter ce soir ou demain, Madame? Demain, dites-vous? Comment vous garder jusque-la, apres ce qui est arrive? DORANTE, plaintivement.
De tout le temps de ma vie que je vais passer loin de vous, je n'aurois plus que ce seul jour qui m'en seroit precieux.
Il n'y a pas moyen, Dorante: il faut se quitter.
On sait que vous m'aimez, et on croiroit que je n'en suis pas fachee.
Helas! Madame, que je vais etre a plaindre! Ah! allez, Dorante, chacun a ses chagrins.
J'ai tout perdu! J'avois un portrait, et je ne l'ai plus.
A quoi vous sert de l'avoir? vous savez peindre.
Je ne pourrai de longtemps m'en dedommager.
D'ailleurs, celui-ci m'auroit ete bien cher! Il a ete entre vos mains, Madame.
Mais vous n'etes pas raisonnable.
Ah! Madame, je vais etre eloigne de vous.
Vous serez assez vengee; n'ajoutez rien a ma douleur.
Vous donner mon portrait! Songez-vous que ce seroit avouer que je vous aime.
Que vous m'aimez, Madame! Quelle idee! Qui pourrait se l'imaginer? ARAMINTE, d'un ton vif et naif.
Et voila pourtant ce qui m'arrive.
DORANTE, se jetant a ses genoux.
Je me meurs! Je ne sais plus ou je suis.
Moderez votre joie; levez-vous, Dorante.
DORANTE se leve, et tendrement.
Je ne la merite pas.
Cette joie me transporte.
Je ne la merite pas.
Vous allez me l'oter, mais n'importe, il faut que vous soyez instruite.
ARAMINTE, etonne.
Comment! que voulez-vous dire? Dans tout ce qui s'est passe chez vous, il n'y a rien de vrai que ma passion, qui est infinie, et que le portrait que j'ai fait.
J'aime encore mieux regretter votre tendresse que de la devoir a l'artifice qui me l'a acquise; j'aime mieux votre haine que le remords d'avoir trompe ce que j'adore.
ARAMINTE, le regardant quelque temps sans parler.
Si j'apprenois cela d'un autre que de vous, je vous hairais sans doute; mais l'aveu que vous m'en faites vous-meme, dans un moment comme celui-ci, change tout.
Ce trait de sincerite me charme, me paroit incroyable, et vous etes le plus honnete homme du monde.
Apres tout, puisque vous m'aimez veritablement, ce que vous avez fait pour gagner mon coeur n'est point blamable: il est permis a un amant de chercher les moyens de plaire, et on doit lui pardonner lorsqu'il a reussi.
Quoi! la charmante Araminte daigne me justifier? Voici le Comte avec ma mere; ne dites mot, et laissez-moi parler.
DORANTE, ARAMINTE, LE COMTE, Mme.
ARGANTE, voyant Dorante.
Quoi! le voila encore! ARAMINTE, froidement.
Oui, ma mere.
(Au Comte.) Monsieur le Comte, il etoit question de mariage entre vous et moi, et il n'y faut plus penser.
Vous meritez qu'on vous aime; mon coeur n'est point en etat de vous rendre justice, et je ne suis pas d'un rang qui vous convienne.
Quoi donc! que signifie ce discours? Je vous entends, Madame, et, sans l'avoir dit a Madame (montrant madame Argante), je songeois a me retirer.
J'ai devine tout: Dorante n'est venu chez vous qu'a cause qu'il vous aimoit; il vous a plu, vous voulez lui faire sa fortune: voila tout ce que vous alliez dire.
Je n'ai rien a ajouter.
ARGANTE, outree.
La fortune a cet homme-la! LE COMTE, tristement.
Il n'y a plus que notre discussion, que nous reglerons a l'amiable; j'ai dit que je ne plaiderois point, et je tiendrai parole.
Vous etes bien genereux; envoyez-moi quelqu'un qui en decide, et ce sera assez.
Ah! la belle chute! Ah! ce maudit intendant! Qu'il soit votre mari tant qu'il vous plaira, mais il ne sera jamais mon gendre.
Laissons passer sa colere, et finissons.
(Ils sortent.) Ouf! ma gloire m'accable; je meriterois bien d'appeler cette femme-la ma bru.
Pardi, nous nous soucions bien de ton tableau a present! L'original nous en fournira bien d'autres copies.

 There is little, if any, doubt that Marivaux was the author of all three of these productions, as well as of the Telemaque travesti, the authorship of which he denied.

 It was not, however, until mille six cent quatre-vingt-neuf that the Hotel des comediens du Roi, entretenus par Sa Majeste installed itself on the rue des Fosses-Saint- Germain, and took the title of Comedie-Francaise.
 As early as mille cinq cent quarante-huit a troupe of Italian comedians had performed at Lyons, for the entrance of Henry deux and Catherine de' Medici.
 On Oct.
douze, mille sept cent sept, their ranks were increased by Dominique fils, particularly clever in the roles of Trivelin.
 "The name indicates a type.
It is, moreover, about the same with the Theatre-Francais of this epoch.
The mothers are called Argante; the widows, Araminte; the artless girls, Angelique or Lucile; the lovers, Dorante, Eraste, Ergaste; the old men, Geronte; the valets, Crispin, Frontin, Trivelin; the peasants, Blaise, etc." Fleury, Marivaux et le marivaudage, pp.
 See Larousse, Article Comedie-Italienne.
 There was a brief period, from mille sept cent dix-sept to mille sept cent vingt-six, in which Crebillon withdrew in discouragement from the theatre.
 Other writers for the Theatre-Italien at this time were Autreau, Delisle, Fuzelier, none of whom is very famous.

 The attitude of Marianne towards her faithless lover and his ultimate return are foreshadowed in the early part of the story, although Marivaux leaves the breach unclosed.
In fact, the opportunity for dramatic action is neglected by Marivaux, whose genius led him to analyses of motives rather than to portrayals of deep feeling or strong emotion.

cinq cent quatre-vingt-sept).
 ARLEQUIN.
One of the brightest and merriest of roles.
In passing to the Comedie-Francaise, this role, which at the Comedie-Italienne was played by Harlequin, was introduced under the name of Pasquin.
The part of Harlequin, in the Italian comedy, appears to have originated in the role of the zanni, or clown, which comprised several varieties, such as Scapino, Coviello, etc.
The costume of the part, whether the zanni represented a stupid lout or a bright and resourceful valet, consisted of a loose jacket, very full trousers, a small cape, a broad-brimmed hat with feathers, and a wooden sword.
This dress was varied later for the parts of Sganarelle and Pierrot, and the Harlequin dress itself was changed to a certain extent in the sixteenth century.
A description of his costume has come down to us from the time of Henry quatre.
"It is composed of a jacket open in front and fastened by cheap ribbons; of tight-fitting pantaloons, covered with pieces of cloth of different colors, placed at random.
The jacket also is patched.
He has a stiff, black beard, the black half-mask, and a cap shaped like those of the time of Francis un; no linen; the belt, the pouch, and the wooden sword.
His feet are clad in very thin foot-gear, covered at the ankles by the pantaloons, which serve as gaiters" (Maurice Sand, Masques et Bouffons, p.
soixante-douze).
It was further changed, as well as the character itself, by the famous Dominique, of the Italian comedians to King Louis quatorze.
He made of Harlequin a clever and witty personage, instead of a stupid lout, and this change was accepted by the writers of plays for that particular troupe.
The dress is greatly modified.
The wooden sword remains, as well as the half-mask, but with a moustache in the place of the former stiff beard.
The modern dress of Harlequin, rarely seen save in pantomimes, is a very brilliant close-fitting costume, composed of small triangles of bright cloth covered with spangles.
 QU'OUI.
The correct form would be que oui, as the initial vowel of oui is now treated as an aspirate.
 CELA VA TOUT DE SUITE, 'That is a matter of course.' 'That is the natural conclusion' (judging from the desire of most girls to marry).
The expression tout de suite now means 'at once,' 'immediately.' It is not in that sense that it is used here.
Read, cela va de suite, considering the adverb tout as simply adding emphasis to the expression.
The word suite was taken in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in the sense of 'consequence' or 'order.'  DE FILLE.
A peculiar use of the substantive after the preposition de, similar to the ordinary participial or adjectival use, as in the expression: Il n'y a que vous de serieux.
Compare "Je n'ai qu'elle de fille" (Moliere, le Medecin malgre lui, deux, quatre).
These, and similar expressions, are an outgrowth of the partitive genitive, usually found after an indefinite: deux n'y a rien de nouveau (that is to say, parmi les choses nouvelles).
Quelque chose de nouveau.
Qu'y a-t-il de nouveau? Cent soldats de prisonniers.
Y a-t-il personne d'assez hardi? etc.
Compare the Latin, Quid novi?  ALLEZ REPONDRE VOS IMPERTINENCES AILLEURS.
This is not a modern form.
The meaning is, 'Keep your irrelevant remarks for people of your own class.' Impertinences has here the meaning of 'irrelevant remarks.'  CE N'EST PAS A VOUS A JUGER.
 CELA EST ENCORE TOUT NEUF, 'That is another strange idea.' Bear in mind that Silvia had already expressed a distaste for marriage.
 AIMABLE, 'Fitted to inspire love,' 'worthy of love.'  DE MARIAGE ...
A peculiar use of the preposition de, allied to, and possibly derived from, the partitive after a negative: Il n'y a pas de mariage.
It would be more natural today to say un mariage ...
une union.
The use of the form de mariage is easily explained by the ellipsis of the concluding words, que celui-ci.
 DELICIEUSE.
Compare: "Il y a de bons mariages; mais il n'y en a point de delicieux" (La Rochefoucauld, Reflexion, cent treize).
 DANS LES FORMES, 'Legally.'  DE QUOI VIVRE, 'Food.'  PARDI, 'Indeed.' An alteration of par Dieu.
Though still used, parbleu, likewise a euphemism for par Dieu, has largely replaced it.
It is not in the Dictionary of the Academy, mille huit cent soixante-dix-huit.
 TOUT EN SERA BON.
The en refers apparently to the divers qualities of Dorante which Lisette has just enumerated, though it is difficult to see the connection clearly.
 TOUT S'Y TROUVE.
The modern form would be, se trouve en lui, the y not being now used of persons.
 HETEROCLITE.
Used familiarly and figuratively for 'strange,' 'odd,' 'peculiar.'  UN PENSEE DE TRES BON SENS--Pleine de sens.
VOLONTIERS, 'Frequently,' 'usually.' 'is usually inclined to be ...'  PASSE, 'We'll let that pass.' Used familiarly for soit.
 OUI-DA, 'Truly,' 'certainly,' or, more freely and familiarly, 'un should think so.' Da is, according to Diez, a shortened form of diva, an exclamation composed of the two imperatives dis and va: diva > dea > da.
It may be added to either the affirmative or the negative (non-da), or stand alone.
In any case it adds force to the expression.
Its use is becoming obsolete, especially in the negative.
 DE BEAUTE.
Quant a la beaute would convey the idea, better to the modern ear.
The construction is the genitive after dispenser.
The pronominal en is.
therefore, redundant.
 VERTUCHOUX, written usually vertuchou, 'Bless me,' A euphemism like vertubleu, which is similarly a corruption of vertu (de) Dieu.
 CE SUPERFLU-LA SERA MON NECESSAIRE.
Voltaire, in his Mondain (mille sept cent trente-six), lines vingt-deux-vingt-trois, repeated the same idea: "Le superflu, chose tres necessaire, A reuni l'un et l'autre hemisphere."  SE CONTREFONT-ILS, 'Disguise themselves.'  AUSSI L'EST-IL.
The modern form is Il l'est en effet.
 NE ...
MENT PAS D'UN MOT, 'Is not at all deceitful.'  NI QUI NE GRONDE.
The repetition of the relative qui is contrary to modern usage.
 AME, 'Being.'  This whole scene recalls the dialogue between Angelique and Lisette in the first scene of Dancourt's l'Ete des Coquettes (July douze, mille six cent quatre-vingt-dix), and may be a clever amplification of the same.
 PORTE ...
UNE GRIMACE.
A metonymy not accepted in common usage.
 DE TOUT CELA == Dans tout cela.
 A CONDITION QUE, 'Provided that.' Governs either the indicative, conditional, or subjunctive.
 UN NOTAIRE.
The notary is a frequent figure in French comedy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and appears also in that of the nineteenth century.
It is he who draws up the marriage settlements; he acts usually as banker and trustee as well as legal adviser.
He is a sworn officer of the government, and nowadays is subject to inspection by officials appointed for the purpose.
 SUR TOUT LE BIEN.
The modern form would be d'apres tout le bien.
 QUE VOUS VOUS REMERCIIEZ, 'That either of you will reject the other.' See Littre, "remercier," cinq deg..
 PLAISANTE, 'Amusing.'  M'EN CONTER, 'To make love to me.'  DES BONS AIRS, 'Kindly reception.' An example of a very common antiphrasis, although the expression in itself is antiquated.
 IL NE ME FAUT PRESQUE QU'UN TABLIER.
An evidence of the similarity in dress of maid and mistress.
There are frequent references to this in the Memoirs of Dangeau, Saint-Simon, and other writers.
 ARTICLE = Passage d'un ecrit quelconque (Littre, "article," trois deg.).
 IMAGINATION.
Used here in the sense of pensee or idee.
 FIGURE, 'Character,' which is also the meaning of personnage in the next line.
 PLAISANT.
See note trente-sept.
 NOTRE FUTURE.
The notre refers to Dorante and his father.
Silvia is the future bride of the one, and the future daughter-in-law of the other.
The expression is not a usual one with notre.
 LE TOUT.
In modern usage the article has disappeared.
 SUR LE CHAPITRE, 'About.'  INSPIREE.
Venue has replaced this verb in some of the later editions, and would certainly be the more natural expression.
 LES AVERTIROIT.
Modern syntax requires the future after the imperative, instead of the conditional present.
 SE TIRERA D'INTRIGUE.
Used in the sense of se tirera d'affaire.
 AGACER, 'Tease.' Taquiner would be the modern word in this sense.
Another and more common meaning of the word is 'picklock,' or 'housebreaker,' from crocheter.
Crochet must have given crochetier.
It is probably due to paronymy that crocheteur and not crochetier has come to be used for 'porter' (Littre).
 DANS SON MIROIR.
An elliptical form for Quand elle se regarde dans son miroir.
 TOUJOURS, 'In the meantime.'  BIEN VENU.
Now written in one word as a noun and with the article.
Corneille has, "Alidor en voulait a Celie" (la Veuve, un.
cent quatre-vingt-un).
"Poppee etait une infidele qui n'en voulait qu'au trone" (Othon, un.
cent quatre-vingt-quatorze).
"Je n'en veux pas, Cleone, au sceptre d'Armenie" (Nicomede, un.
trois cent quarante-sept).
And La Fontaine: "Comme il en voulait a l'argent" (les deux Mulets, un.
huit).
The Academy gives the locution in its Dictionary, with the remark: "signifie aussi familierement, Avoir quelque pretention sur cette personne, sur cette chose, en avoir quelque desir.
Il en veut a cette fille.
Il en veut a cette charge."  AILLE SUR MES BRISEES, 'Be my rival.' Les brisees.
Branches broken off by a hunter to recognize the hiding-place of the game, hence 'traces.' Suivre les brisees de quelqu'un, 'To follow someone's example.' Aller sur les brisees de quelqu'un, 'To contest with (or rival) someone' (Littre, "brisees," un deg.
and deux deg.).
 VOUS PERDREZ VOTRE PROCES, 'You will get the worst of it.'  ILS SE DONNENT LA COMEDIE, 'They are making fun at my expense.'  QUI L'AURA, 'Who wins his love.'  M'EN CONTER.
See note trente-huit.
 NOUS SOMMES DANS LE STYLE AMICAL.
An expression derived from the precieuses.
 OTER MON CHAPEAU.
It was still customary to wear the hat in the house, even in the presence of ladies, though the habit was dying out.
 JOUE.
The edition of mille sept cent trente-deux, as well as that edited by Duviquet, gives joue.
Some later editions give jure, in the sense of 'blaspheme.'  PLAISANT.
See note trente-sept.
 ME FASSE MON PROCES, 'Destroys my hopes.' Compare note soixante-dix.
 D'ABORD QUE.
Used for the more modern des que (Littre, dix deg.).
 MALGRE QUE J'EN AIE, 'In spite of myself.' Malgre que in this sense is used only with the verb avoir (Littre, cinq deg.).
 A TORT AVEC TOI.
The modern form is envers toi.
 A PLUS DE TORT.
The de has since been dropped in locutions of this sort.
 JE CROIS QU'IL M'AMUSE, 'un think that he strikes my fancy.'  JE ME RAPPELLE DE.
In modern French the de is omitted.
 CONFIDEMMENT.
Confidentiellement the more common form.
 NE PRENDRE PAS GARDE.
The modern construction of the negative with an infinitive requires both parts of the negative to precede the verb.
 EN FAVEUR DE = Dans l'interet de.
 MON PORTE-MANTEAU.
Refers not to the valise, but to the crocheteur who carried it.
The office of porte-manteau was an honourable one at the French court.
Twelve officers of the household bore the title and discharged the duties of the office, which consisted in taking care of the king's hat, gloves, stick, and sword, and in handing them to his majesty when called for.
One of these officers always accompanied the king when hunting, with a valise containing raiment.
See A.
Cheruel, Dictionnaire historique des institutions, moeurs et coutumes de la France.
 AUTANT VAUT, 'That's the same thing.' 'That's just as good.'  LA BELLE.
The use of the article is here indicative of familiarity.
Used in this way towards inferiors.
 JE VAIS FAIRE DESCENDRE.
On the part of a supposed servant, a somewhat free and easy expression.
 UN BEAU-PERE DE LA VEILLE OU DU LENDEMAIN, 'A man who is as good as my father-in-law.'  AVANT QUE DE.
Avant de is more modern.
 L'HOTEL.
In the meaning attached to the word in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, that is, 'mansion,' 'residence.' Originally applied specifically to the king's residence, it soon was used of the mansions of the nobility in Paris or other towns.
Later, the habit arose among the nobility of renting rooms and apartments within their mansions when the family was not in residence, and gradually the word assumed its present more extended meaning.
But hotel is still used to denote strictly a residence.
 PLAISANT.
 M'EN ETRE FIE A TOI.
The en here is difficult to construe.
It refers to the whole of the preceding clauses.
In modern construction it would be omitted.
 DANS LES SUITES.
'After this,' 'henceforth.' For dans la suite.
 DONNERAI DU MELANCOLIQUE.
The more ordinary form is donnerai dans le melancolique.
 PLAISANTE, 'Agreeable.' See note quatre-vingt-quinze.
 QUE DE CET INSTANT.
The modern form would be qu'a l'instant.
 SI MAL BATI, 'In such a bad state.' Colloquial.
 RAGOUTANT, 'Tempting,' 'pleasing.' Its earlier and more common meaning is, 'tempting to the palate.' As used here it is familiar, and corresponds with the rest of Harlequin's expressions, though it is by no means an expression confined by Marivaux to servants.
Compare: "Ne voila-t-il pas un amant bien ragoutant!" (Marianne, troisième partie).
"Cependant comme cette personne etait fraiche et ragoutante..." (Le Paysan parvenu, premier partie).
"Et a quel age est-on meilleure et plus ragoutante, s'il vous plait?" (id., cinquième partie).
 TRINQUER, 'To drink a toast.' From the German trinken, Italian trincare.
This verb shows a much more jovial spirit than would the verb boire, and, in this case, is more familiar and inelegant.
 SI VOUS NE METTEZ ORDRE.
After the conjunctions a moins que (unless), and si, in the same sense, the second part of the negation (pas) is omitted.
The il refers not to Arlequin, whom Lisette takes for Dorante, but to the idea that she should be loved by one so much her superior socially.
 CELA NE LAISSERA PAS QUE D'ETRE, 'It will be no less true.' The idiom may be expressed more logically by the omission of the que (Littre, "laisser," vingt deg.).
 D'HOMME D'HONNEUR.
An ellipsis for the more complete expression which later editions print, foi d'homme d'honneur.
 J'AI MENAGE SA TETE, 'un have spared his mind,' 'un have handled him carefully.'  LE MOMENT.
For l'occasion.
 A VUE DE PAYS, 'From the looks of things.'  FAIT.
Some later editions print tourne.
The idea is the same.
 JUSQUE LA, 'To such a degree.'  A LA BONNE HEURE, 'As you please.'  AVANT QUE DE.
See note quatre-vingt-treize.
 DE VOTRE FACON, 'Brought forth by you.' The whole figure is both trivial and bombastic, in perfect accord with the role of Harlequin.
 ROQUILLE.
An ancient wine measure amounting to a quarter of a setier.
A setier, in the current use of the word, was equal to half a pinte.
A pinte was a little less than a litre (Hatzfeld and Darmesteter).
Hence a roquille would be less than an eighth of a litre.
A synonym for any small measure.
 COMME UN PERDU, 'Desperately.'  VALETAILLE, 'Whole set of valets,' Composed of valet and the pejorative ending aille (Littre).
 SERA.
The text of mille sept cent trente-deux has fera, but this is likely a  misprint, as the f's and long s's were easily confounded.
 IMPERTINENT.
Here the actor taking the part of Dorante, profiting by the inattention of Lisette, administers to Harlequin a vigorous kick, which the latter is obliged to receive with equanimity, much to the amusement of the spectators.
This byplay is also a reminiscence of the habits of the early comediens italiens, who indulged to excess in lazzi, which originally meant, not witticisms, but tricks more or less buffoon in their nature, such as circus clowns still indulge in.
We know that Marivaux objected to any liberty being taken with the roles by the actors.
It may well be questioned whether the above-mentioned gesture would have met his approval.
In a letter written to Sarcey (published in Quarante ans de theatre, tome deux, pp.
Contat les fit entrer, vers mille sept cent quatre-vingt-quatorze et mille sept cent quatre-vingt-seize, au Theatre de la Republique."  DEBARRASSE-MOI DE TOUT CECI.
A contemptuous expression by which Dorante designates Lisette.
It is entirely in keeping with the manners of the day.
 NE TE LIVRE POINT.
Livrer is here taken in the sense of 'betray.'  LA QUESTION EST VIVE, 'That is a leading question.'  UN PETIT BRIN.
Equivalent to un petit peu.
Brin means 'spear' (of grass, etc.), and, as in the case of goutte (drop) and of mie (crumb), has come to indicate any small particle.
Often idiomatically translated by 'bit.'  J'AI PEUR D'EN COURIR LES CHAMPS, 'un am afraid of losing my reason.' Compare the expression, etre fou a courir les rues, a courir les champs, 'to be stark mad ' (Littre, "courir," vingt-trois deg.).
 DECOMPTER, 'Deduct.' Still used, though not commonly, for rabattre.
 LES MAITRES.
On may be followed by the plural, if taken in a plural sense, although some later editions give the singular, le maitre.
In fact, after this indefinite pronoun, a noun, adjective, or participle may agree in gender and number with the person or persons to whom the indefinite refers.
 FONT ...
A LEUR TETE, 'Have their own way.' The idiom faire a sa tete means 'to do as one pleases.'  BEAU JEU.
The idiom avoir beau jeu is a card term, and means first, 'to hold the best cards,' and hence, 'to have a good opportunity.'  PERRETTE OU MARGOT.
Names of the lower classes among servants.
The idea is carried out by the reference to the visit to  the cellar and the flat candlestick.
Compare: "Ne semble-t-il pas qu'il faille tant de ceremonies pour parler a madame? On parle bien a Perrette" (Marianne, deuxième partie).
Perrette, from the well-known fable of La Fontaine, Perrette et le pot at lait, has come down to us as the personification of the dreamer, the builder of air-castles.
Margot, a diminutive of Marguerite, is a common term for the chatterbox.
 FAUTES D'ORTHOGRAPHE, 'Misapprehensions as to real rank.' The ordinary meaning of the expression, used figuratively, is fautes de conduite.
 NE VOILA-T-IL PAS! An exclamation of surprise.
A curious example of deformation.
Originally feminine nouns beginning with a vowel took the feminine ma before them, the vowel of ma being elided.
Thus, m'amie; but later the word was modified to its present form.
 QU'ON NE LES APPELLE.
Que in the sense of sans que requires the negative particle ne.
It is less frequently used to-day than in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
Sans qu'on les appelle might replace this expression.
 PUISQUE LE DIABLE LE VEUT.
An uncomplimentary variant of the proverb.
The en here must refer to comme elle tourne les choses, in Silvia's last remark.
 TOUJOURS, 'Still.'  ME NOIRCIR L'IMAGINATION, 'Soil my thoughts.' Marivaux has very consistently preserved the character of the high-born lady that Silvia is, in the remarks he puts into her mouth.
It is impossible for her to forget her real rank, or to forget her usual way of considering menials as of an inferior race.
 OBJET.
Usually, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, denotes a woman loved.
Occasionally Corneille, like Marivaux here, employs it to denote a man loved.
This, however, is infrequent.
 A MOI.
There is an ellipsis at the end of Silvia's remark, which, completed, would read: Il n'y aurait pas grande perte a cela.
Dorante's reply, which is not strictly grammatical, even in the use of the time, would certainly nowadays be constructed differently, e.g., Non plus que si je m'en allais aussi, moi.
 NE SONT BONNES QU'EN PASSANT, 'Can only be indulged in once in a while.'  JE NE SUIS PAS FAITE POUR ME RASSURER TOUJOURS, 'un do not feel that un could always be sure of...'  CELA NE RESSEMBLEROIT PLUS A RIEN.
The sense is: "My attitude towards you would be so extraordinary that it might become compromising" (Larroumet).
 IL N'EN SEROIT NI PLUS NI MOINS = Cela ne changerait rien.' It would make no difference.'  J'AMUSERAI, 'Shall un flatter with vain hopes?' Compare: "Il veut que je l'amuse, et ne veut rien de plus" (Corneille, Sertorius, deux, trois).
"Car vous lui promettez tous les huit jours de l'epouser dans la semaine, et il y a pres d'un an que vous l'amusez" (Dancourt, Le Chevalier a la Mode, un, sept).
 JE T'EN ASSURE.
The en here is unconnected with any other part of the sentence.
In modern construction it would not be used.
 TE RENDRE SENSIBLE.
An expression very frequently, indeed generally, used in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries for me faire aimer de toi.
A reminiscence of the days and modes of thought of the precieuses and the whole tribe of writers of novels after the manner of l'Astree.
 SANS DIFFICULTE, 'Undoubtedly.'  IL NE MANQUOIT PLUS QUE CETTE FACON-LA, 'This is the finishing stroke.'  DANS LE RESPECT.
The modern form is par le respect.
 POUR DANS.
An awkward expression.
The pour might better have been omitted.
Later editions give simply dans.
 HUMEUR.
'Temper,'  SI FORT SUR LE QUI-VIVE, 'Take offence so readily.'  DANS QUELLE IDEE.
_De would be used nowadays instead of _dans.
 QUI NE ME CHOQUE.
In relative clauses depending upon a negative antecedent, the second part of the negative (pas) in the relative clause is generally omitted.
 CES MOUVEMENTS-LA.
'Emotion.' Compare: "D'un mouvement jaloux je ne fus pas maitresse" (Racine.
quatre).
"L'ame n'est qu'une suite continuelle d'idees et de sentiments qui se succedent et se detruisent: les mouvements qui reviennent le plus souvent forment ce qu'on appelle le caractere" (Voltaire, Supplement au siecle de Louis quatorze.
deuxième partie).
 QUERELLEE, 'Taken her to task.'  UN ESPRIT.
In ordinary French of the present day the un would be omitted.
 SURPRISE.
The feminine form of the participle is admissible after on.
 UN MAUVAIS ESPRIT.
Referring to Silvia, although the idea is clear, grammatical consistency is overthrown in the next line when the pronoun la is used instead of le.
 DE LA CONSEQUENCE, 'What may be inferred.'  EST.
Some later editions give soit.
This difference in the mode used in various editions is but another proof of the elasticity of the subjunctive in French.
Either mode is here correct, the indicative expressing greater positiveness, and the subjunctive more doubt, in the supposition.
 J'Y METS BON ORDRE, 'un look after that,' or 'un see that he doesn't.
See note cent quatre.
 APOSTILLE, 'Observation.' Literally 'postscript,' from ad and postillam (low Latin for 'explanation,' 'note.' Littre).
 AIMABLE, 'Courteous.'  QUE TU NE ME CHAGRINES.
See note cent trente-sept.
 JE T'EN OFFRE AUTANT, 'un can say the same to you.'  MOUVEMENTS.
See note cent cinquante-neuf.
 OU.
Later editions give que, which is preferable in modern French.
The relative pronoun should not follow a construction similar to that of its antecedent placed in the clause immediately preceding.
The same is true of the conjunctive adverb ou (P.
Larousse).
One should not, therefore, say: C'est a vous a qui je parle.
C'est dans cette maison ou je suis ne.
C'est ici ou je l'ai trouve.
C'est de toi dont il ecrit.
Que preferred in each case.
 A QUI.
See preceding note.
A construction much blamed by all modern authorities, although common to Marivaux, and used also by Boileau, Moliere, and others.
"C'est a vous, mon Esprit, a qui je veux parler" (Boileau, Satire neuf, un.
i).
"Mais, madame, puis-je au moins croire que ce soit a vous a qui je doive la pensee de cet heureux stratageme..." (Moliere, L'Amour medecin, trois, vi).
In this case que would be better than a qui, and is so printed in most of the later editions.
 PENETRER = Decouvrir.
 AVANT QUE DE.
See note quatre-vingt-treize.
 NEUVE, 'Novel.' Compare: "C'etait bien le plan le plus original, le plus beau, le plus neuf!" (Merimee, la Guzla, avertissement).
 IRREGULIER, 'Unseemly,' 'impolite.'  JUSQUE LA.
See note cent quinze.
 LUI FEROIT TORT.
Here modern usage requires the partitive du.
 SUR L'ARTICLE DE, 'Concerning,' 'in the matter of.'  LUI.
Marivaux felt the charm of this artless reply, and repeated it in l'Epreuve (see Introduction, p.
lxiii), with the added epigram of Lisette: "Et quel est donc cet homme qui s'appelle lui par excellence?"  GUIGNON, 'Bad luck.' From guigner ('to ogle,' 'to peep'), and has some connection with the idea of the evil eye (Littre).
 CELA N'EST POINT CONTRAIRE A FAIRE FORTUNE.
Cela n'empeche pas de faire fortune is more modern and better French.
 IMAGINATION.
See note quarante-quatre.
 IL LUI PREND.
Il is redundant, and in some of the later editions is omitted.
 ACCOMMODONS-NOUS, 'Let us compromise.' Compare: "Le Ciel defend, de vrai, certains contentements; mais on trouve avec lui des accommodements." (Moliere, le Tartuffe).
 FRIAND, 'Eager.' Primarily friand signified the gift of a delicate taste, and a rare appreciation of dainties.
As used by Harlequin it recalls his ragoutant.
note cent trente-deux.
 HABIT DE CARACTERE.
Garb which designates, which characterizes any particular profession.
As used here, it signifies Harlequin's livery as valet.
 GALON DE COULEUR, 'The fact that un wear livery.' The reference is to the braiding on the livery-coats worn by the retainers and domestics of the nobility in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, as well as at the present day.
"Apres son deuil (the author speaks of Lauzun, who had gone into mourning for the Grande Mademoiselle), il ne voulut pas reprendre sa livree, et s'en fit une de brun presque noir, avec des galons bleus et blancs" (Saint-Simon, Memoires, un).
 BUFFET, Side-table, on which are placed the dishes destined for table service, and on which they may be left after clearing the table.
The servants probably often ate the 'leavings' at this table, which may have given rise to the term buffet for the servants' eating-room, which is the sense in which the word is used here.
Compare: "Je suis las d'etre bien battu et mal nourri...
Je suis las enfin d'avoir de la condescendance pour vos debauches, et de m'enivrer au buffet, pendant que vous vous enivrez a table" (Regnard, Attendez-moi sous l'orme, Sc.
l).
 SUCCES = Resultat.
 EN CONTEZ A.
See note trente-huit.
 LE LANGAGE BIEN PRECIEUX.
The use of the expression du gout, in the sense of 'a liking,' 'a fancy,' was much more recherche in the eighteenth century than now.
Hence Mario's feigned surprise at hearing such words from the lips of a supposed valet.
Compare: "Gout, en galanterie, simple inclination, amusement passager, mot des gens de cour" (De Caillieres, mille six cent quatre-vingt-dix).
 A LE BIEN PRENDRE, 'If you look at things rightly.'  PASSEZ, 'Overlook.'  LES, in later editions mes, which is evidently the better form.
 EST BIEN AUSSI, for tout aussi.
 QUE JE NE L'AIME.
See note cent trente-sept.
 TON COEUR A DE CAQUET, 'How effusive your heart is.'  CELA VAUT FAIT = C'est comme si c'etait fait: Regardez la chose comme faite (Dict.
of the Academy, mille huit cent soixante-dix-huit).
 IMPERTINENCE = Mesalliance.
 ET IL EST TOUT AU PLUS UNI.
Compare: "Elle aurait cru se degrader par le soin de son menage, et elle ne donnait pas dans une piete si vulgaire et si unie" (le Paysan parvenu, quatrième partie).
 BIEN CONDITIONNEE, 'In pretty good condition,' 'pretty well turned (upset).' A peculiar use of this past participle.
 LE, referring, of course, to Dorante, and not to tete, as the gender of the pronoun shows.
 PRENDRAI DE PART, 'Care for.'  QU'IL S'ACCOMMODE, for the more modern qu'il s'arrange.
 SI JE LUI DIS, for si je le lui dis.
Marivaux often omits the direct object pronoun in similar constructions.
See le Legs, note vingt-cinq, and les Fausses Confidences, note cent vingt-sept.
 LE, see note deux cent sept.
ESQUIVIEZ LA MIENNE.
An absurd metonymy, perfectly consistent, however, with Harlequin's jargon, and very similar to the fifth example of Marivaudage, Introduction, p.
 IL EN ETOIT QUELQUE CHOSE, 'That is about the truth.'  ENTREPRIS LA FIN DE MA VIE, 'Do you intend to make me die?'  AVANT QUE JE LA DEMANDE A LUI, etc.
The modern construction of this sentence would be: Avant que je ne la lui demande, souffrez que je vous la demande a vous.
 RENDRE MES GRACES.
In modern usage the mes is omitted in this locution.
 NENNI, 'No.' An antiquated negative particle, coming from non illud, as hoc illud gave oil > oui (Littre).
 IL This second il refers to present.
See note quinze.
 FAUTES D'ORTHOGRAPHE.
See note cent trente-quatre.
 N'APPRETONS POINT A RIRE, 'Let us give them no occasion to laugh at us.' Appreter a rire, Littre, huit deg., also Dict.
de l'Acad., mille huit cent soixante-dix-huit.
 HABIT D'ORDONNANCE, 'Livery.' Until mille six cent soixante-six the regiments in the French army wore the livery of the colonel commanding.
After that date they wore the king's livery or uniform, though some regiments, more highly favored, wore the actual colors of the royal livery; the uniform was in fact nothing but a mark that the wearers belonged to the sovereign.
Harlequin has played upon this fact in a preceding scene, when he has called himself "un soldat d'antichambre."  CELA NE LAISSE PAS D'ETRE.
See note cent neuf.
 TANT Y A QUE, 'However that may be,' or 'Nevertheless, the truth is that.'  LA VOILA BIEN MALADE, 'She is pining with love for me.'  PAR LA VENTREBLEU, Ventrebleu, written also ventrebieu, is a euphemism for ventre (de) Dieu.
A familiar interjection; admitted by the Academy, mille huit cent soixante-dix-huit.
For the la, compare a similar corruption of palsambleu (par le sang [de] Dieu) into par LA sambleu, and corbleu (corps [de] Dieu) into par LA corbleu.
 CASAQUE.
Harlequin's loose upper garment or jacket.
 SOUQUENILLE.
A long outer garment of coarse cloth, worn especially by grooms in the care of their horses.
 UN AMOUR DE MA FACON, 'A passion inspired by me.'  SUJET A LA CASSE, 'Apt to be thwarted.'  Casse--literally 'breakage.'  FRIPERIE, 'Old clothes.' Used colloquially; as in English, 'duds.'  POUSSER MA POINTE, 'Carry out my purpose.'  LA MIENNE.
Refers to friperie.
 NOUS L'AVONS DANS NOTRE MANCHE.
"Avoir une personne dans sa manche, En disposer a son gre" (Dictionnaire de l'Academie francaise).
The expression, no doubt, is derived from the custom of using the full sleeves as a receptacle for all manner of objects to be carried about by the wearer at a time when pockets were not worn.
It is still in vogue in certain cases-- military officers, for instance, carry their handkerchiefs in their left sleeve.
Theophile Gautier, in his Voyage en Italie, speaks of giving to a couple of monks "quelques zwantzigs pour dire des messes a notre intention.
Les bons peres prirent l'argent, le glisserent dans le pli de leur manche."  PATE D'HOMME.
A familiar expression for 'sort of a man.'  VOUS M'EN DIREZ DES NOUVELLES, 'You will see that un am right.' See Nouvelle, Littre, un deg..
Compare: "(Madame Patin) Tu ne sais ce que tu dis.
(Lisette) Vous m'en direz des nouvelles" (Dancourt, le Chevalier a la Mode,  VOS PETITES MANIERES, 'Your rude manners.' By apposition to les belles manieres, the manners of a class above one's own.
 NOUS VIVRONS BUT A BUT, 'We shall live on the same footing.' To understand Harlequin's impertinent remark, it must be remembered that while he is well aware of the real rank of both Lisette and Silvia, Dorante is still ignorant of it.
Harlequin knows his master to be in love with the latter, and to be about to marry her, in spite of the apparently tremendous difference in rank, and allows himself a little sarcasm at the expense of his master.
This attitude of the domestic towards his superior is not infrequent in the comedies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
 PREVENU, 'Forestalled.'  CE N'EST PAS A MOI A ...
See note sept.
 ENTENDEZ.
Entendre is here used for comprendre.
 EST-CE A VOUS A VOUS PLAINDRE.
See note sept.
Some later editions print de vous plaindre.
 VOUS RENDRE SENSIBLE.
See note cent cinquante-trois.
 VOUS ETES SENSIBLE A, 'You share.'  JE N'Y TACHERAI POINT.
This construction would not now be admissible.
The modern form would be, Je ne tacherai point de le faire.
 LE MERITE VAUT BIEN LA NAISSANCE.
A theme often repeated by Marivaux.
Compare: "Son exemple encourageait quiconque avait du merite sans naissance" (Voltaire, Russie, un, douze).
Voltaire founded his comedy, Nanine, upon this line of Marivaux.
The Comte d'Olban has fallen in love with Nanine, a girl brought up by his mother, the Marquise d'Olban, and who occupies the position of half maid, half companion.
Note that this is the first time Dorante has so addressed Silvia.
That is because it is only now that he has learned her real rank.
 ALLONS, SAUTE, MARQUIS! from Regnard's le Joueur (mille six cent quatre-vingt-seize), quatre, vi.
 LISETTE.
An interesting type.
See Introduction, p.
 LEPINE.
One of the three valets of Marivaux which may be considered as new types.
See Introduction, p.
 DE CETTE GRANDE JEUNESSE, 'So very young.'  L'EVENEMENT, 'The result,' 'outcome.'  MOYENNANT, 'Considering.' The modern meaning is 'in  consideration of.'  NOUS SOMMES A CETTE CAMPAGNE.
A for dans, the modern form.
 GASCON FROID.
A type striking by reason of its exception to the general class.
Gascon is often synonymous with boaster, liar, and blusterer.
Composure or sobriety is the least of his virtues, and when found may perhaps give reason for distrust.
Compare the character of de Guiche in Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac: "Le Gascon souple et froid" (Act I, Sc.
iii).
"Rien de plus dangereux qu'un Gascon raisonnable" (Act quatre, Sc.
iii).
 MONSIEUR DE LEPINE.
This title, though often ironically or latteringly given to Lepine throughout the play, goes far to show the type of independent valet one has to deal with here.
 INCONTINENT, 'Immediately.' From the Latin in continenti.
 SUR LE MEME TON.
Equivalent to pied, the modern form.
 DE SOUPCONS.
There is an ellipsis here: Pour ce qui est de soupcons.
More usually: Quant a avoir des soupcons, j'en ai, etc.
 JE DIFFERE AVEC VOUS DE PENSEE.
This form would scarcely be used nowadays.
Je ne suis pas de votre avis would be preferred.
 D'OU VIENT.
See Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent vingt.
 LE TOUT EST EGAL, 'Every condition is alike (in that respect).' This expression would be replaced in modern French by tout etat est bon.
 MONS, an abbreviation for Monsieur.
Used to express contempt.
 D'HOMME D'HONNEUR.
The complete expression would be Foi d'homme d'honneur.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent dix.
 JE VOUS EN OFFRE AUTANT.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent soixante-treize.
 C'EST TOUT AU PLUS SI JE CONNOIS ACTUELLEMENT LA VOTRE, 'It is saying a good deal if un even know yours now.'  DESSUS.
Later editions print sur, which would be the modern expression.
 SANDIS.
A Gascon oath.
For sang (de) Dieu.
morbleu, parbleu, ventrebleu.
None of these expletives, any more than mon Dieu should ever be translated literally--They have wholly lost their original force and meaning.
 OUI-DA.
See Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note vingt et un.
 N'Y VOYEZ-VOUS RIEN.
Note the use of y applied to a person.
with the use of the third person.
 REVENANT, 'Pleasing.'  DISTINGUE.
Distinguer sometimes means 'to examine with a view to marriage.' Compare: "Est-ce que je l'aimais? Dans le fond je le distinguais, voila tout; et distinguer un homme, ce n'est pas encore l'aimer" (Marivaux, l'Heureux Stratageme, un, quatre).
 D'ABONDANCE.
This idiom generally means 'offhand,' but it is undoubtedly used here in the sense of d'abondant, 'moreover,' an expression already antiquated, and usually replaced by the idiom de plus.
 GENS.
Generally used, if preceded by a possessive adjective in the sense of 'servants.' Compare Harlequin's exclamation: "Ah! les sottes gens que nos gens!" (le Jeu, etc., deux, six, p.
quarante-deux), which has become almost proverbial.
 DES DECLARATIONS, LA COMTESSE LES EPOUVANTE.
The meaning is perfectly clear, though the construction is not satisfactory according to modern rules.
 NE LUI DISE.
For ne le lui dise.
As has been said, Marivaux not infrequently omits the direct object pronoun in similar constructions.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent dix, and les fausses confidences, note cent vingt-sept.
 CETTE ENFANCE, 'That sort of childishness.' Compare: "Vous venez de pleurer; c'est une enfance" ...
(Marianne, troisième partie).
Also: "Ce sont des betises ou des enfances dont il n'y a que de bonnes gens qui soient capables" (id.
deuxième partie).
See les fausses confidences, note cent cinquante et un.
 QU'EN SERA-T-IL? 'What will be the result?'  SIMPLESSE, Simplicite ingenue.
Antiquated, according to Hatzfeld and Darmesteter.
The Dictionary of the Academy (mille huit cent soixante-dix-huit) admits it with the meaning of ingenuite, accompagnee de douceur et de facilite.
 OCCURRENCE, 'The possible case.' Occurrence always signifies an unforeseen circumstance,' 'an emergency.' Compare: "N'oublie jamais que tu as pour le moins la moitie de part a tout ce que je fais dans cette occurrence" (le Paysan parvenu, premier partie).
 QUE LA COMMODITE VOUS TENTE, 'Let the convenient opportunity,' etc., 'Let your own convenience (or advantage) tempt you.'  NE ME VALENT RIEN.
The modern form is n'ont aucune valeur pour moi.
 REPARTE, 'Reply,' from repartir, used in the sense of repondre, repliquer, riposter.
Compare: "Je ne repartis rien a ce discours mais mes yeux recommencerent a se mouiller" (Marianne, troisième partie).
 QU'IL ME FAIT BESOIN, 'That un need it.' FAIRE BESOIN = etre necessaire.
Common to the writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
Compare: "S'il vous faisait besoin, mon bras est tout a vous" (Moliere, le Depit amoureux, v, trois).
 SANDIS.
See note vingt.
 QU'UNE AUTRE.
The edition of mille sept cent quarante prints qu'un autre, but this must be a mistake.
 D'OU VIENT.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent vingt.
 JE VOUS FEROIS UN FORT BON PARTI, 'un would settle a handsome sum on you both.'  DERECHEF, 'Once more.' Compound of de, re, and chef (Lat.
caput).
Growing obsolete, and replaced in modern French by de nouveau or encore une fois.
 ELLE ME FAIT TANT D'AMITIE, 'She inspires me with so much love.'  DECONFORTEZ, for the more modern decouragez.
 N'EN TENEZ COMPTE.
Tenir compte may be used in the negative without the addition of pas or point.
Compare: "Il n'en a tenu compte." (Racine, les Plaideurs, un.
i.) The negative is to-day, however, generally completed.
 LA GARONNE.
A river in the southwestern part of France, rising in the valley of Aran, in the Spanish Pyrenees, then flowing northward and northwest past Toulouse, Agen, and Bordeaux, to its juncture with the Dordogne, with which it merges its waters to form the Gironde.
A not uncommon term for the Gascons is Enfants de la Garonne.
 GARE, "Take care." From the verb garer.
Prenez garde que is the more natural modern expression.
 MALEPESTE, 'Confound it.' Compare our exclamation, 'plague on it.' It is an antiquated expression composed of male (feminine) and peste.
Admitted by the French, Academy in mille sept cent soixante-deux, but not included in the dictionary of mille huit cent soixante-dix-huit.
 JE N'AVOIS GARDE D'Y ETRE, 'un had no idea whom you meant.' The idiom n'avoir garde de means 'to be unable' or 'to be far from' (Littre, "garde." sept deg.).
 JE NE LUI EN VEUX POINT DE MAL, 'un don't wish him any harm.' Pleonastic for je ne lui veux point de mal.
 DONT.
Better que.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent soixante-quinze.
 J'Y AI MIS BON ORDRE.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent quatre; le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent soixante-neuf.
 IL NE S'Y JOUERA PAS, 'He will not try that.' Se jouer a quelque chose, 'To attempt something' (Littre, trente et un deg.).
 D'OU VIENT.See Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent vingt.
 VOUS TENIR, 'To confine yourself,' Vous en tenir is the modern form.
 VUE.
The text of mille sept cent quarante gives the form vu.
 IL SE FAIT LE SCRUPULE, 'He is anxious not to,' Faire scrupule (without the article) is more modern.
 VOUS N'Y SONGEZ PAS, 'What are you thinking of?' Cf.
note cent deux, and see les fausses confidences, note cent cinquante-quatre.
 ON NE PEUT PAS MOINS.
An ellipsis for on ne peut pas l'aimer moins que je ne le fais.
 ARRANGE.
 QUAND JE SEROIS AUTRE CHOSE, 'Even should un be something more.'  JE NE LAISSEROIS PAS QUE D'EN ETRE SURPRISE.
See Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent neuf.
 C'EST QUE VOUS NE CONNOISSEZ QU'ELLE.
A figure of speech conveying this idea: 'You are very well acquainted with her.'  OUI-DA.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note vingt et un.
 CE N'EST PAS QU'IL N'Y AIT DU RISQUE, 'After all, there is some danger.' Ce n'est pas que in the sense of apres tout may introduce either the indicative or the subjunctive with ne.
The article of the partitive du is retained because of the affirmative character of the phrase.
 LA PLUPART.
Some later editions print pour la plupart.
The idea is the same.
 IL N'Y AUROIT QUE FAIRE DE, 'un would have no need to.' Compare le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent quarante et un.
 PRENEZ.
Used in the sense of supposez.
 NE LE VOILA-T-IL PAS, 'Just see how (far from the point he is).' See le jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent trente-cinq.

 QU'OUI.
See Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note trois.
 D'OU VIENT ...
ME L'AVEZ-VOUS LAISSE IGNORER.
This peculiar and somewhat awkward construction is not uncommon to Marivaux.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent vingt.
It would now be written que vous me l'avez laisse ignorer, etc.
 J'ENTENDS.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent quarante-sept.
 IMAGINATION.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note quarante-quatre.
 TOUT A L'HEURE = tout de suite, not a modern use.
See les Fausses Confidences, note cent cinquante-deux.
 J'ENTENDS.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent quarante-sept.
 AVANT QUE DE.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note quatre-vingt-treize.
 PASSONS NOTRE CONTRAT, 'Let us sign the marriage settlements to-day.'  ICI, an early use instead of -ci.
 HETEROCLITE.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note dix-huit.
 RAGOUTANT.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent deux.
The word has seemed too coarse to the actors of to-day, and has been replaced by agreable.
 PASSER.
See note soixante-dix-neuf.
 TOUT A L'HEURE.
See note soixante-seize.
 JE N'AI QUE FAIRE DE SORTIR, 'un do not need to go out.' Compare le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent quarante.
 CETTE SOTTE! equivalent to quelle sotte.
It will be noticed that the French make a very large use of the demonstrative where in English the article would be employed.
In such cases as the present the English would be: 'What a ...'  AVEC LE MEDECIN PAR-DESSUS.
Doctors have been the butt of jests from time immemorial.
Compare: "Nuper erat medicus; nunc est vespillo Diaulus: Quod vespillo facit, fecerat et medicus" (Martial, un, un, Epigram xlviii).
"En depit des medecins nous vivrons jusqu'a la mort" (Leroux de Lincy.
Proverbes, t.
un, serie v).
"De jeune medecin cimetiere bossu" (Leroux de Lincy, Proverbes, t.
serie v).
"Dans les discours et dans les choses, ce sont deux sortes de personnes que vos grands medecins.
Entendez-les parler, les plus habiles gens du monde; voyez-les faire, les plus ignorants de tous les hommes" (Moliere, le Malade imaginaire.
trois, trois).
Votre savoir, mon camarade, These reproaches were, it must be owned, fully justified by the practice of almost all doctors, which was marked by ignorance and barbarism.
 TRANSPORT AN CERVEAU, 'Delirium.'  SANDIS.
See note vingt.
 LA BELLE CONSEQUENCE, 'What difference does that make?' Used in the sense of la belle raison.
 C'EST AUTANT DE RESTE PAR LES CHEMINS, 'un would be as good as left on the highway.' Compare le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cinquante-quatre.
 D'AUJOURD'HUI.
The modem meaning of this form is 'from to-day,' but it is used here in the sense of 'this day.'  JE VIS SOUFFRANT.
Used in the sense of Je suis souffrant.
 FOURNIR LA COURSE, 'manage to reach my journey's end.'  JE FEROIS DES CRIS.
Ferois for pousserois.
 COMMENCOIS D'EN.
The modern form is commencois a.
 FROISSE, 'Bruised.' Used in the sense of meurtri (Dict.
de l'Acad., mille huit cent soixante-dix-huit).
 IL N'EN SERA NI PLUS NI MOINS.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent cinquante.
 OUI-DA.
See Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note vingt et un.
 De bon jeu, 'Seriously.'  DIANTRE.
A euphemism to disguise the word diable, as bleu for Dieu in many exclamations (Littre).
 VOUS N'Y PENSEZ PAS, 'What are you thinking of?' Compare note cinquante-huit, and les Fausses Confidences, note cent cinquante-six.
 J'Y SERAI TOUJOURS.
For the more modern Je le serai toujours.
 AIME.
A singular failure to carry out the agreement of the verb in the relative clause with its antecedent.
Aimez would be the correct form.
 C'EST S'EGORGER, 'It is madness.'  VOS FUREURS, 'Your mad purpose.'  LE.
The edition of mille sept cent quarante prints the article le, but the demonstrative ce would carry out the sense better.
 CELA DE PLUS.
Accompanied with some gesture of impatience, perhaps a snap of the thumb-nail against the teeth.
With us a snap of the fingers would accompany the words.
 INSTRUIT.
That is to say, 'informed' about the matter in hand.
 SI CE N'EST.
= Sinon.
 LA FAIRE.
Le would be more natural, referring to reste, which is masculine.
La evidently refers back to somme.
 PRETENDS, 'Expect.'  RENDRE RECONCILIES.
The simple infinitive reconcilier is more natural French.
Marivaux has purposely lent this loosely constructed expression to Lepine.
de Sevigne uses "rendre revoltee."  SANDIS.
See note vingt.
 ENTENDS.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent quarante-sept.
 EN PUISSANCE D'EPOUX.
A law term meaning: "Qui ne peut contracter ni disposer de rien sans etre autorisee de son mari" (Dict.
de l'Acad., mille huit cent soixante-dix-huit).
Used often in the mere sense of 'married,' as here.
Compare: "Je ne comprends meme pas qu'elle se soit amourachee d'un homme en puissance de femme" (Augier, les Effrontes, v, quatre).
 RIT.
This use of the verb rire in the sense of plaire is not uncommon.
 LA SERVITUDE.
An incorrect use of the abstract noun.
Lepine, doubtless, means les serviteurs, les domestiques.
Compare: "Ne sais-tu pas que les petits scrupules ne conviennent qu'aux petites gens?" (J.J.
Rousseau, la Nouvelle Heloise, quatre, treize.
The same idea differently applied).
 CE QUI EST DE CERTAIN.
With est taken in the sense of il y a, the construction is correct.
The modern form would be, Ce qui est certain.
 SANS DIFFICULTE.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent cinquante-quatre.
 ARTICLE, 'Matter.'  DISPUTE.
The correct modern word is conteste.
On dispute sur une chose.
 ENTENDS.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent quarante-sept.
 JE N'AI CONNU MES MIGRAINES.
Equivalent to Je n'ai eu des migraines.
 PROCUREUR, 'Attorney.' "Name given formerly to the public officer called to-day avoue" (Littre).
An avoue is an officer whose duty it is to represent the parties before the tribunals, and to draw up the acts of procedure (Littre).
 AVOCAT, 'Lawyer' or 'Counsel.'  D'OU VIENT.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent vingt.
 C'ETOIT BIEN LE MOINS, 'un could do no less.'  PAS TANT DE TORT, ET QUE C'EST...
The modern form would be: tellement tort, et est-ce ma faute.
 A MOINS QUE JE N'Y SOIS POUR RIEN, 'Unless un have no part in it.'  A TOI A QUI IL EN AURA OBLIGATION.
Later editions print A toi qu'il en aura obligation, which is the better form.
See page soixante et un, notes un and deux.
 CONGEDIIEZ.
The edition of mille sept cent quarante prints the form congediez, which would be impossible to-day.
 PLAISANTE.
See Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note trente-sept.
JAMAIS, 'Your answers are no more addressed to me than to some one who never spoke to you.' A very complicated and unwieldy phrase.
See Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent soixante-quinze and note cent soixante-seize.
 COMME VOTRE AVERSION M'ACCOMMODE, 'How cruelly your aversion treats me.' Accommoder (Littre, quatre deg.), antiquated.
 DIFFICILE.
The text of mille sept cent quarante gives different, which would make no sense here.
Difficile, moreover, is the general rendering.
 DE RESTE, 'Only too well.' Notice the difference in meaning between this expression and du reste or au reste ('moreover').
 CE QUE JE PENSE.
Some of the later editions give the more complete expression, ce que j'en pense.
 AUX.
The use of the preposition a after avoir regret is less frequent to-day than that of de.
 ARAMINTE.
A young widow of independent character, in whose mind the prejudice of rank and wealth is not so great as to be insurmountable.
One of Marivaux's favourite types.
 MONSIEUR REMY.
The uncle of Dorante, a man of rough exterior and crusty humour, frank to an extreme, overbearing with his nephew, but ready to take his part, a regular burbero benefico (with which character of Goldoni's comedy, compare).
 PROCUREUR.
See le Legs, note cent vingt-six.
 MADAME ARGANTE.
An imperious, selfish, vain, old woman, of the type Marivaux generally chooses for the mothers in his comedies.
 ARLEQUIN.
When this play passed to the stage of the Comedie-Francaise, the name of Arlequin, familiar to the Italian comedy, was changed to Lubin, and his dress modified to suit the new role.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux.
 DUBOIS.
A "real creation" among the valets of Marivaux.
Like Lepine of le Legs, he is quite above the station of the traditional valet, and may well be called Monsieur Dubois.
The intrigue of the piece is entirely in his hands, and is carried out with the shrewdness and dexterity of an able man of affairs.
 JOAILLIER.
One who works in, or sells, joyaux ('jewels'), 'a jeweller.'  DETOURNEZ.
Used in the sense of derangez (Littre, dix deg.).
 N'EN FAITES PAS DE FACON.
The en nowadays would be considered superfluous, and facon would be put in the plural.
The use of en is peculiar in this case, for it refers to the idea partly expressed by Dorante.
It stands for Ne faites pas de facons parce que je me derange pour vous.
 HONNETE, 'Polite,' 'civil.' Notice the use of the singular, following the rule that after the pronouns nous and vous, when these pronouns designate a single person, even if the verb is plural, the adjective remains singular.
 QU'IL.
A laquelle would be better than que, in modern French.
The construction of the sentence is somewhat awkward, and betrays the lingering influence of the Latin forms, still so evident in many of the best seventeenth century authors, such as Bossuet, whose use of qui and que is very striking.
In the eighteenth century the language was acquiring greater freedom, but it is not until the nineteenth that it rids itself of much of the old syntax.
 PROCUREUR.
See le Legs, note cent vingt-six.
 UNE GRANDE CHARGE DANS LES FINANCES.
Marivaux refers to the ferme generale, a syndicate of capitalists that exploited the taxes levied by the government, and collected by the fermiers generaux and their subordinates.
The business was an exceedingly lucrative one for the members of the syndicate, who made large fortunes out of the profits of their contract with the State.
The comedy of Lesage, Turcaret, turns upon the intrigues and swindles of one of these traitants or partisans, as they were also called.
Dancourt, in his Chevalier a la mode, introduces a pretentious widow, Mme.
Patin, of whom her maid says: "Mme.
Patin, la veuve d'un honnete partisan, qui a gagne deux millions de bien au service du roi!" (Act un, Sc.
un).
 PEROU.
The gold mines of Peru gave rise to the use of the name as synonymous with wealth.
Compare: "Madame Thibaut est un petit Perou pour Monsieur de la Brie." (Dancourt, Femme d'intrigues, un, deux.)  VOUS M'EN DIREZ DES NOUVELLES.
See le jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent quarante-deux.
 DIANTRE.
See le Legs, note cent un.
 LA.
Dans la tete, with a gesture.
 DERANGE.
'Disorderly' or 'irregular' (in his affairs).
 SERVITEUR AU COLLATERAL, 'Then the collateral heirs will have to go without.' Serviteur au is here used in the sense of tant pis pour.
Serviteur is not infrequently used as a formula of dismissal.
 VOUS METTEZ.
An inverted order quite common in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the second of two imperatives is construed with an object pronoun.
Compare: "Quittez cette chimere, et m'aimez " (Corneille).
"Polissez-le sans cesse et le repolissez" (Boileau, Art Poetique, Chant un).
 DONT.
Que would preferably be used to-day, so as not to repeat the construction of the antecedent.
Compare _le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent soixante-quinze.
 QU'IL VOUS REVIENNE, 'That you like him.'  MONSIEUR PREVIENT EN SA FAVEUR, 'The gentleman's appearance speaks in his favour.'  GRACES.
In modern French the singular is preferred.
 COMME S'EN ALLANT, for, _comme en s'en allant.
 PARTI, 'Position' (Littre, dix deg.).
The idea of 'salary' is conveyed by the word as used here.
 RENVERRAI TOUT.
That is to say, tout ce qui se presentera; 'un will dismiss all other applicants.'  PARTI.
See note vingt-sept.
 REPRESENTE, 'call attention, 'set forth'; a form often used in petitions.
 PARDI.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note quinze.
 A VOTRE AISE LE RESTE, 'The rest when you like.'  D'OU VIENT PREFERER CELUI-CI.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent vingt.
 ARRETE, for the modern French engage ('engaged').
 IL ME TARDE, 'un long.'  EN PASSE, 'In a position to.'  D'ALLER A TOUT.
For the more modern expression d'arriver a tout, 'to attain any height.'  DEFAITE, 'Excuse' or 'pretext' (Littre", quatre deg., also Diet, de l'Acad.
mille huit cent soixante-dix-huit).
 ELEVATION.
 REFLEXION ROTURIERE.
Roture was the expression used to denote the bourgeoisie as distinguished from the nobility.
 JE N'Y ENTENDS POINT DE FINESSE, 'un cannot enter into such subtle distinctions on the question of happiness.' She refuses to discuss the possibility of Araminte's preferring happiness to rank.
For her, rank means happiness, as would wealth.
 IL ME L'A PARU = Cela nil a paru ainsi.
 D'OU VIENT.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent vingt.
 J'Y METTRAI BON ORDRE.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent soixante-neuf.
 PLAISANT.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note trente-sept.
 TIMBRE COMME CENT, 'As crazy as a loon.' It is difficult to preserve the figure in an idiomatic translation.
Compare the colloquial English, "You act like sixty."  CERVELLE BRULEE.
A peculiar use of cervelle.
Brulee is used here by Marivaux in the sense troublee, as in the passage from Mme.
de Sevigne: "Mme.
de Saint-Geran est toute brulee du depart de son mari."  IL EN EST COMME UN PERDU, 'He is like a man who has lost his reason.' Cf.
le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent vingt.
 UN PEU BOUDANT.
Nowadays the adverb follows the verb.
Here boudant might at first thought be taken for an adjective, but it is a present participle used verbally and consequently invariable.
 ON A BIEN AFFAIRE DE, 'un have no use for.' This idiom must not be confounded with avoir affaire a, which means 'to have to deal with.'  ESPRIT RENVERSE, 'A crazy man.'  MALEPESTE.
See le Legs, note quarante-huit.
 AVANT QUE DE.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note quatre-vingt-treize.
 IL N'Y AVOIT PLUS PERSONNE AU LOGIS, 'He was quite unconscious.' (Littre, "logis," un deg..)  D'EPIER.
Later editions print qu'epier, as d'epier would not be admissible in modern French.
Que de rever...
que d'epier would be the most natural modern form.
 PAYOIS BOUTEILLE = Payais a boire.
 LA COMEDIE.
The Comedie-Francaise, or Theatre-Francais, then, as now, the leading theatre in Paris.
 DES QUATRE HEURES.
The performance did not begin before five o'clock, in the eighteenth century,  DANS L'HIVER.
The modern form is en hiver.
 JURANT PAR CI PAR LA, 'Swearing every now and then.'  AUX TUILERIES.
The Cours-la-Reine, in the Champs-Elysees, the Tuileries gardens, and the Palais-Royal, with its covered galleries and its garden, were the fashionable resorts of promenaders in the eighteenth century.
 CE QU'IL.
The ce is superfluous.
 PERCER = S'apercevoir.
 JE ME REMETS = J'y suis.
 OUI-DA.
See Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note vingt et un.
 COMME PASSANT, for comme en passant.
Compare les Fausses Confidences, note vingt-six.
 C'EST AUTANT DE PRIS.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cinquante-quatre.
 QU'EST-IL = Pourquoi est-il?  PARDI.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note quinze.
 IL LES FAIT COMME IL LES A.
Untranslatable, save by an equivalent.
It is a pun on Dubois' remark: "making eyes at her."  PRENEZ TOUJOURS, 'Take note of them nevertheless."  LE.
The text of mille sept cent cinquante-huit prints le; ce would carry out the sense even better.
See le Legs, note trente-huit.
 APPAREMMENT, 'Evidently.' This adverb may be used with or without the conjunction que to introduce a verb.
 D'OU VIENT.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent vingt.
 UNE GUENON, 'a fool.'  QUI SE FASSE = Qu'il y ait.
 LES PETITES-MAISONS.
The old Maladrerie de Saint-Germain, which in mille cinq cent cinquante-quatre became the Hopital Saint-Germain, later known as les Petites-Maisons, on account of the great number of cells into which it was divided.
It was used to house infirm old men and women, who received a small weekly dole, lunatics, and patients suffering from loathsome diseases.
The name became synonymous with either a mad-house or a hospital for certain diseases: it was changed in mille huit cent un to les Petits-Menages, the insane having then been transferred, the men to Bicetre, the women to La Salpetriere.
 BIEN VENANTS, 'Paid regularly.' Marivaux, like the authors of the preceding century, considered bien venants as an adjective, and hence declinable: but livre is feminine, and we should expect here the form bien venantes.
The Academy has declared the expression indeclinable.
Compare: "Je le voyais avec vingt-huit mille livres de rente bien venantes" (Mme.
de Sevigne, Dec.
vingt-huit, mille six cent quatre-vingt-neuf).
 APPAREMMENT.
See les Fausses Confidences, note soixante-quatorze.
 PARDI.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note quinze.
 VOUS N'AVEZ POINT DE GRE A ME SAVOIR.
A well-known idiom, better expressed to-day: Vous n'avez point a me savoir gre.
 D'AVEC.
A shortened form for some such phrase as d'une conversation avec.
D'avec is generally to be translated 'from,' 'in contradiction to.'  A QUEL HOMME EN VEUT-IL? 'For what man is he looking?' Compare le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note soixante-huit.
 A VOUS.
Aupres de vous would be the modern expression.
 LE FAISANT SORTIR.
Note the peculiar use of le, which nowadays would be replaced by the noun to which it refers--le garcon.
 DONT.
Better que.
See Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent soixante-quinze.
 DESSUS.
For la-dessus.
 SANS DIFFICULTE.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent cinquante-quatre.
 DE NE VOUS PAS AIMER.
De ne pas vous aimer is the more natural order in modern French.
 IL N'A QUE FAIRE DE, 'He has no need to.' Compare le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note, cent quarante et un.
 C'EST UN PORTRAIT DE FEMME.
The construction of the sentence is peculiar and incomplete.
It requires the introduction, before c'est un portrait, of the words c'est que.
In modern French the awkwardness of this form would be obviated.
In the second clause que would have to be prefixed to c'est ici.
 QUAND.
Puisque is also found in incomplete expressions of this kind.
The thought might be completed as follows: Mais, quand (or puisque) je vous dis, etc., vous devriez me croire.
 ENTENDU, used here in the sense of compris.
 HUPPEES, 'Fancy,' 'smartly dressed.' It often means 'smart.' Compare; "Combien en as-tu vu, je dis des plus huppees." (Racine, Les Plaideurs, J, quatre); "Bien huppe qui pourra m'attraper sur ce point!" (Moliere, Ecole des femmes, un, un).
 JE N'EN RABATS RIEN, 'un retract nothing.' That is to say, 'un insist that it is the Count.'  PLAISANT, 'Ridiculous.'  COMME DE CELA.
With some gesture of contempt.
See le Legs, note cent huit.
 LUI.
For le.
The verb defier governs to-day the accusative and not the dative.
 QU'IL.
Later editions print qui, which is the correct form.
The thought may be expressed more simply by the phrase Je l'avais vu le contempler.
 CE QUI EST DE SUR = Ce qu'il y a de sur.
 LE SUJET = La raison.
 DE BONNE MAIN, 'By a reliable person.' (Littre, "main," dix-septº.)  CONSENS...
The verb consentir takes either de or a, before a following infinitive, although in modern French the latter is the more common.
 TOUS PROCES.
Later editions print tout proces, which is the more natural modern form.
The plural, in the sense of 'each' or 'every' is, however, sometimes found without the article.
Compare: "L'auteur des dialogues a dit que les belles sont de tous pays, et moi je dis que les sottises sont de tous les siecles " (Fontenelle, Jugement de Pluton).
 AVOIR PRISE ...
AVEC, 'To have a dispute with.' PRISE, 'Quarrel,' 'dispute' (Littre, six deg., also Dict.
de l'Acad., mille huit cent soixante-dix-huit).
 TOUS.
Later editions print tout, which is the modern form.
In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries is was not customary to consider the adverbial tout as necessarily invariable.
 MOUVEMENT.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent soixante-deux.
 DONT.
Que is preferable.
See _Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent soixante-quinze.
 SAVOIS.
A not uncommon use of the imperfect indicative in the sense of the conditional.
 JE N'AUROIS QUE FAIRE DE.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note soixante-huit.
Compare le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent quarante et un, and le Legs, note quatre-vingt-cinq.
 A TOI.
The English idiom is 'of you.'  AU MOINS, 'Nevertheless.'  CAPABLE.
Most editions print incapable, beginning the sentence with s'il, and punctuating with a comma after incapable.
The sense is better carried out with such a rendering.
 Des biais = Des moyens detournes.
 L'EN DEDIRE = Le dementir.
 COMME S'EN ALLANT.
See les Fausses Confidences, note vingt-six.
 A CE QU'IL EST NE = A sa naissance.
 C'EST DE DORANTE, for Il est de Dorante: 'It has been painted by Dorante.'  M'EN FAIRE ACCROIRE, 'To impose upon me.'  AVANT QUE DE.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note quatre-vingt-treize.
 This speech of Dorante's and Araminte's answer seem to have inspired Augier and Sandeau in the scene between Bertrand and Helene, in Mlle.
de la Seigliere, Act trois, sc.
 QUE MON AMOUR N'EN AUGMENTE.
See Le jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent trente-sept.
 JE L'AI PEINTE.
The peinte refers to and agrees with la in Dorante's preceding speech.
 AVANT QUE DE.
See Le jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent dix-sept.
 RUE DU FIGUIER.
A very ancient and historic street in Paris, situated not far from the Lycee Charlemagne, and making a triangle with the rue Charlemagne and the rue Fauconnier.
Even before the year mille trois cents it bore this name, from a fine fig-tree which stood at its juncture with the rue Fauconnier, and which was standing as late as mille six cent cinq.
The most important edifice of the street is the Hotel de Sens, built in the sixteenth century by the Archbishop Tristan de Salazar.
It was for a time the residence of Marguerite, first wife of Henry quatre.
 JE LUI RECOMMANDERAI.
Later editions print je le lui recommanderai.
Attention has already been called to Marivaux's custom of omitting the direct object pronoun in similar constructions.
Compare le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent dix, and le Legs, note vingt-neuf.
 MOUVEMENTS.
See Le jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note cent soixante-deux.
 LUI.
See note quatre-vingt-dix-neuf.
 FATIGUE, 'Importune' (Littre, quatre deg.).' Compare: "Ainsi donc mes bontes vous fatiguent peut-etre" (Racine, Berenice, deux, quatre).
 AMUSER.
See Le jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note quarante et un.
 EN FAIT DE DISCRETION, JE MERITERAIS D'ETRE FEMME.
Discretion means here 'the ability to keep a secret' (Littre, cinq deg.).
Compare; "Rien ne pese tant qu'un secret:  LE DIABLE N'Y PERD RIEN, is said of a person who restrains his feelings with difficulty, or only temporarily (Littre, "diable." deux deg.).
The whole phrase might here be translated by: 'She cannot conceal the matter, nor will un.'  ENTENDS.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent quarante-sept.
 OUI-DA.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note vingt et un.
 DEMEURE.
The incorrect use of this verb by Harlequin adds to the comic of the piece.
For correct French one might substitute se trouve.
 LA RUE DU FIGUIER.
See note cent vingt-six.
 SAIS.
Savoir as used here means 'to know about the street,' 'to know that it exists,' 'to know where it may be found'; connaitre would mean 'to be acquainted with it.'  RENDRA = Remettra.
 RENDREZ.
Some of the later editions print rendez.
 QUE JE N'AIE VU, 'Until un have seen.' The negative particle ne is required in a phrase introduced by que, when this conjunction stands in the place of avant que.
 PRESOMPTIONS.
'Presumptions' or 'reasonable suppositions.' Compare: "Ce ne sont pas la des convictions entieres; mais ce sont les presomptions les plus fortes" (Voltaire, Essai sur les moeurs et l'esprit des nations, chap.
cent soixante-six).
 DE VOTRE FACON, 'Of your choosing.'  TOUT.
Later editions print tout le monde, which is evidently the sense in which this word is used.
 ROGUE, 'Arrogant.' In the edition of mille sept cent cinquante-huit the word is printed roque, which has led some editors into the error of correcting to rauque (hoarse).
 NOUS N'AVONS QUE FAIRE ENSEMBLE, 'We have no dealings together.'  NON QUE JE SACHE.
Non, pas que je sache is the more complete modern expression.
 A CAUSE QUE.
Parce que is more modern.
Littre favors the retention of a cause que, since it is used by good authors, and, in certain cases, is preferable to parce que.
 AMPLIFIE, 'Exaggerates.'  HORS D'OEUVRE = Hors de propos.
Generally used to-day as a substantive, but in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries often used adverbially as here.
Compare: "Dans le Cid, toutes celles (the scenes) de l'infante sont detachees, et paraissent hors d'oeuvre" (Corneille, Horace, Examen).
 ENFANCE.
For the more modern word enfantillage, although the Dict.
de l'Acad., mille huit cent soixante-dix-huit, retains the word in this sense.
Compare: "Ils ne font que des enfances" (Mme.
de Sevigne, Jan.
vingt-six, mille six cent quatre-vingt-neuf).
"On passait encore les enfances a Mme.
la duchesse de Bourgogne par la grace qu'elle y mettait" (St.
deux cent quatre-vingt-quatorze, six).
"Ce sont des betises ou des enfances dont il n'y a que de bonnes gens qui soient capables" (Marianne, deuxième partie.) See le Legs, note vingt-neuf.
 TOUT A L'HEURE.
In the sense of tout de suite the expression is to-day obsolete, and is not admitted by the Dict.
de l'Acad., mille huit cent soixante-dix-huit.
See le Legs, note soixante-seize.
 A CAUSE QUE.
See note cent quarante-sept.
 ENTEND.
See le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard, note deux cent quarante-sept.
 APPAREMMENT, 'Manifestly,' 'Of course.' In this sense the word has become obsolete, and is not admitted by the Dict.

 VOUS N'Y SONGEZ PAS.
See le Legs, note cinquante-huit, le Legs, note cent deux.
 DELIVREE.
The edition of mille sept cent cinquante-huit prints delivrees, which will be accounted for by the speaker's including madame Argante in his mind.
The singular is, however, preferable.
 EUS.
The edition of mille sept cent cinquante-huit prints the past participle eu, without making it agree with the preceding object pronoun.
See le Legs, note cinquante-six.
 NOUS DIS.
For the position of the object pronoun see note dix-huit.
 EUES.
The edition of mille sept cent trente-huit prints eu.
For similar carelessness in Marivaux's use of the past participle compare le Legs, note cinquante-six, and note cent cinquante-huit.
