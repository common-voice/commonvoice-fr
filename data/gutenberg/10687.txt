Tarascon! Tarascon! (Nimes, May treize, mille huit cent quarante; Paris, December seize, mille huit cent quatre-vingt-dix-sept) Alphonse Daudet was born in the ancient Provencal city of Nimes, near the Rhone, May treize, mille huit cent quarante.
In this same year Emile Zola, destined like Daudet to pass his youth in Provence, was born at Paris.
As a result of the commercial upheaval which attended the revolution of mille huit cent quarante-huit, Daudet's father, a wealthy silk manufacturer, was ruined.
After a hard struggle he was forced to give up his business at Nimes and moved to Lyons (mille huit cent quarante-neuf).
He was not successful here, and finally, in mille huit cent cinquante-six, the family was broken up.
The sons now had to shift for themselves.
These first sixteen years of Alphonse Daudet's life were far from unhappy.
He had found delight in exploring the abandoned factory at Nimes.
His school days at Lyons were equally agreeable  to the young vagabond.
His studies occupied him little; he loved to wander through the streets of the great city, finding everywhere food for fanciful speculation.
He would follow a person he did not know, scrutinizing his every movement, and striving to lose his own identity in that of the other, to live the other's life.
His frequent days of truancy he spent in these idle rambles, or in drifting down the river.
Literary ambition had already seized him; he had written a novel (of which no trace remains) and numerous verses.
Notwithstanding his lack of application to study, he had succeeded in completing the course of the lycee.
The boy was too young, too delicate, and too sensitive to be able to endure the mental suffering and humiliation to which he was subjected at the hands of the bullies of this school.
After a year of martyrdom he set out on his terrible journey to Paris.
Here he was welcomed by his brother Ernest.
[Footnote un: See "Le Petit Chose," "Little What's-His-Name."] The two brothers had always felt and always continued to feel the closest sympathy for each other.
They could earn scarcely enough to satisfy their most pressing needs, but both were happy, since they were in Paris.
Before Alphonse's arrival Ernest had secured regular employment on a newspaper.
Alphonse was longing for recognition as a poet, but to earn his living he was forced to turn to prose.
His contributions to Le Figaro and other newspapers soon made him known.
He wrote little and carefully, nor did he forget his literary ideals even when poverty might have excused hurried productions in the style best calculated to sell.
His literary conscience was as strong under the trying circumstances of his debut as later when success brought independence.
[Footnote deux: See est Daudet, "Mon Frere et moi," pp.
cent cinquante et un-cent cinquante-deux.
He was living, un think, outside of the city, in a remote corner with other poets, a band of joyous Bohemians.
There was in him something of the Parisian Street gamin and something of the Oriental woman." [Footnote un: "Les Romanciers naturalistes," pp.
deux cent cinquante-six-deux cent cinquante-sept.] Daudet's first volume was a collection of verse, "Les Amoureuses" (mille huit cent cinquante-huit, published by Tardieu, a Provencal).
These simple poems are charming in their freshness and naivete, and established Daudet's reputation as a writer of light verse.
The whole volume, and especially "Les Prunes," attracted the attention of the Empress Eugenie.
At her solicitation Daudet was made one of the secretaries of the powerful Duke of Morny, president of the corps legislatif (mille huit cent soixante).
His duties were purely nominal.
He now had money enough to keep the wolf from his door and was free to devote himself to literature.
It was at this time that the stage began to attract him.
His first play, "La Derniere Idole," was produced at the Odeon in mille huit cent soixante-deux.
Almost every other year between mille huit cent soixante-deux and mille huit cent quatre-vingt-douze a new play, on untried themes, or adapted from one of his novels and usually written in collaboration, appeared at a Parisian theater.
Of all these only one, "L'Arlesienne" (mille huit cent soixante-douze), is worthy of its author.
Already in mille huit cent cinquante-neuf, as a result of the suffering of the preceding years and lack of precautions, his health had begun to fail.
He spent the winters of mille huit cent soixante et un-mille huit cent soixante-quatre in Algeria, Corsica, and Provence.
 These voyages were of vital importance in his development.
 He learned something of the world and became better fitted to study conditions in his own narrow sphere; at the same time he acquired the power of vigorous description and collected material for some of his finest short stories and for the Tartarin series.
A portion of the summer of mille huit cent soixante et un he dreamed away in an abandoned mill near Fontvieille, between Tarascon and Arles.
It is here that we find several of his most excellent stories: "Le Secret de maitre Cornille", "La Chevre de Monsieur Seguin", "La Mule du pape", "Le Cure de Cucugnan", "L'Elixir du reverend pere Gaucher" and others.
[Footnote un: Daudet did not live in the mill which he has made famous, but he spent there "de longues journees"; he never owned it, but the deed which serves so picturesquely as preface to his book is not entirely apocryphal.
See "Trente Ans de Paris," p.
cent soixante-quatre.] In mille huit cent soixante-cinq, at the death of Morny, he gave up his secretaryship and applied himself exclusively to literature.
In mille huit cent soixante-six he met Julie Allard, and early the next year they were married.
To his wife, a lady of exquisite taste, Daudet owed unfailing encouragement and competent, sympathetic criticism.
"Le Petit Chose," his first long work, had been begun in mille huit cent soixante-six during his stay in Provence; it was published in mille huit cent soixante-huit.
The first part, which is of great interest, is largely autobiographical and covers the childhood and youth of the writer up to his first years in Paris; the second part is a colorless romance of no particular merit.
Daudet himself confessed that the work had been written too soon and with too little reflection.
"un wish I had waited," he said; "something good might have been written on my youth".
[Footnote un: See "Trente Ans de Paris," pp.
soixante-quinze, quatre-vingt-cinq, and Sherard, "Alphonse Daudet," p.
trois cent un.] "Tartarin de Tarascon" was written in mille huit cent soixante-neuf.
Success and happiness had crowned Daudet's efforts.
He was spending his time in all tranquility, now at Paris, now at Champrosay, where he occupied the house of the painter Delacroix.
Suddenly in July, mille huit cent soixante-dix, the war cloud burst.
Daudet lay stretched out on his bed fretfully nursing a broken leg.
On his recovery he shouldered his gun and joined in the hopeless defense of Paris.
It was the war that killed the old Daudet and brought into existence the new.
Before the war, Daudet himself confesses it, he had lived free from care, singing and trifling, heedless of the vexing problems of society and the world, his heart aglow with the fire of the sun of his native Provence.
The war awakened in our sensitive poet a seriousness of purpose which harmonized but little with his native genius.
Among his friends he never lost his old-time buoyant gaiety; but his works from now on show only a trace of it.
The charming "Belle-Nivernaise" (mille huit cent quatre-vingt-six), a few "tarasconades," a gleam here and there in all his works, remind us of our old friend and plead for our sympathy with the new.
The playfulness of the youthful Daudet is still apparent here and there in the war stories ("La Pendule de Bougival," "Les Petits Pates"), but a sterner tone is prevalent.
The great novels which now follow are the fruit of meditation, the ripening process which the war precipitated, and which was fed from the flame of Flaubert, Goncourt, Zola, and others.
Neglecting almost entirely those elements of his genius which came to him as his birthright, he devotes himself henceforth to a study of the problems of life.
Our Provencal cicada has a purpose now: nothing else than the reformation of all social abuses.
He does not single out one and attack it time after time, but he springs restlessly from one to another, directing high and low his relentless inquiry.
"Fromont jeune et Risler aine" (mille huit cent soixante-quatorze) is the first of Daudet's great novels and one of his strongest studies.
Sidonie, the daughter of humble bourgeois parents, is filled with a longing for luxury and social prominence.
She succeeds in becoming the wife of Fromont, a simple, honest workman whose talent and industry have brought him wealth.
Sidonie's unscrupulousness in the pursuit of her object spreads ruin.
Risler, the partner of Fromont, withdraws large sums from the common treasury to satisfy the extravagant desires of Sidonie whom he loves.
Fromont's  eyes are at last opened; he finds the firm, which had always been his pride, on the verge of bankruptcy; he discovers the perfidy of Sidonie and attempts to force her to beg on her knees the forgiveness of Risler's long-suffering wife.
Sidonie flees and becomes a concert-hall singer.
Her revenge is complete when by means of a letter she proves to Fromont that she has corrupted his much-loved younger brother.
Fromont hangs himself.
Daudet up to this time had been recognized as the greatest of French short-story writers.
The success of "Fromont jeune et Risler aine" was immediate, and in his succeeding novels he confirmed more and more surely his right to a place in the front rank of French novelists.
From this story of the life of the petite bourgeoisie he turns to a wider field.
The Bohemia of Paris, a glimpse of the country, and especially the life of the artisan, fill "Jack" (mille huit cent soixante-seize).
Daudet had known the real Jack at Champrosay in mille huit cent soixante-huit.
In the novel Jack is the illegitimate son of Ida de Barency, a shallow demi-mondaine who is passionately devoted to the boy but brings to him nothing but misfortune.
Jack begins his suffering in a wretched school where his mother has placed him after the Jesuits had refused to receive him.
This school is supported by the tuition fees of boys from tropical countries, petits pays chauds, as Moronval, the villainous director, calls them.
The teachers belong to that class of rates, artistic and literary failures, whom Daudet learned to know well during his first years in Paris.
One of these rates captivates Ida de Barency, and Jack's life of misery continues.
Despite his physical unfitness, he is sent to labor in the shipbuilding yards at Indret, suffers tortures in the stoking room of an ocean steamer, is wrecked, and returns to France in a piteous condition.
His love for Cecile, granddaughter of a gentle country doctor, is rapidly making a man of him, when his mother enters again into his life and the poor boy dies miserably in a hospital, killed by despair rather than by disease.
This is perhaps the most powerful of Daudet's novels; it is certainly the most harrowing.
The tragedy of the whole is only slightly relieved by the interweaving of the romance of good Belisaire, the hawker, one of Jack's few friends.
"Le Nabab" (mille huit cent soixante-dix-huit) is concerned with politics, the richer bourgeoisie, and the aristocracy.
Jansoulet, the "nabob," returns from Tunis with a large fortune and immediately becomes the prey of parasites.
He is made the enemy of the banker Hemerlingue through the social rivalry of their wives.
He is elected depute from Corsica.
The legality of the election is questioned.
Jansoulet is supported by the prime minister, the duc de Mora, but the latter dies suddenly, Jansoulet's election is declared invalid, and he dies from a stroke of apoplexy.
Despite the protest of the author, contemporaries found originals for a number of the characters of this novel.
The duc de Mora is Morny, and several others have been identified with greater or less certainty.
Felicia Ruys is perhaps Sarah Bernhardt.
The purely romantic element of the work is found in the story of Paul de Gery and the Joyeuse family, a secondary plot having no vital connection with the main story.
In "Les Rois en exil" (mille huit cent quatre-vingts) Daudet explores a new vein in contemporary society.
He explains that the idea of the work occured to him one October evening when, standing in the Place du Carrousel, he was contemplating the ruins of the Tuileries.
The wreck of the Empire brought to his mind a vision of the dethroned monarchs whom he had seen spending their exile in Paris: the Duke of Brunswick, the blind King of Hanover and the devoted Princess Frederica, Queen Isabella of Spain, and others.
"This is the work which cost me most effort," Daudet says, and the reason is not far to seek.
He had always painted "from life," and the difficulties incident to gaining an entrance into the intimacy of even dethroned monarchs were almost insurmountable.
The novelist's acquaintances were appealed to, from house-furnishers to diplomats.
The story of the composition of "Les Rois en exil" is an interesting study of Daudet's methods, his inexorable insistence on truth, even to the most minute details.
As usual, the characters are sharply contrasted.
Christian, the exiled king of Illyria, is detestably weak; Frederique, his wife devoting herself completely to the interests of her son, Zara, struggles with the aid of the faithful preceptor, Meraut, to prepare the prince for a throne which he is never to ascend.
Of all the characters that appear in Daudet's novels it is perhaps Frederique whose appeal to the reader is strongest, and Frederique is almost entirely the product of the author's imagination.
We cannot but regret the many visions such as Frederique which were refused admittance to Daudet's essentially romantic mind by the uncompromising laws of a realism which he had mistakenly accepted as his guide.
The composition of "Les Rois en exil" is defective, but its charm is great.
In "Numa Roumestan" (mille huit cent quatre-vingt-un) the technique is better.
Daudet's first intention was to entitle this work "Nord et midi," his idea being to contrast the north with the south, a theme for which he always had a predilection.
Numa is a refined Tartarin; Daudet sends him to Paris, and studies the result.
Numa carries all before him by his robust vigor and geniality.
The "mirage" effects of the southern sun pursue him to Paris; quick to promise out of the fullness of his hearty enthusiasm, he encourages and disappoints those who trust themselves to him.
He deceives his wife, begs her forgiveness with abundant tears, and in a disgusting manner deceives her a second time.
The book ends with the picture of Rosalie Roumestan bending over her new-born son.
"Will you be a liar too?" She asks.
"Will you be a Roumestan, tell me?" "L'Evangeliste" (mille huit cent quatre-vingt-trois), a psychological study rather than a novel, is a heartbreaking picture of the inhumanity of religious fanaticism.
"Sapho" (mille huit cent quatre-vingt-quatre) is so essentially French in spirit that it can hardly be understood by American readers.
Daudet dedicates it "To my sons when they are twenty." It is intended as a lesson, and if naturalistic works ever can carry a lesson this one certainly does.
It is a striking picture of the evils of faux menages.
On the whole "Sapho" is disagreeable, yet of the novels it seems to be Daudet's masterpiece, perhaps because it is the most romantic.
 The truth may be photographed in its most minute realistic details, as in Zola, or it may be colored by poetic fancy; this has happened in "Numa Roumestan" and especially in "Sapho," the two novels of Daudet which appear most likely to live.
In "Sapho" there is a tender note which is lacking in "Jack" and in "Fromont jeune et Risler aine"; Daudet's nature fitted him to inspire pity rather than indignation.
And we must remember that while writing "Sapho" he had in mind the future of his own sons.
He looks forward, and in hope of a fortunate issue tells frankly, in a kindly manner, a true story  which he hopes may be fruitful of good results.
"Sapho" is the last of the great novels.
"L'Immortel" (mille huit cent quatre-vingt-huit) is a weak and unjust satire directed against the French Academy.
"Rose et Ninette" (mille huit cent quatre-vingt-douze) is a study of the evils of divorce; "La Petite Paroisse" (mille huit cent quatre-vingt-quinze), the only one of the novels with a happy outcome, is a study of jealousy.
Long years of suffering follow, but, although in almost constant pain, the indefatigable worker remains at his desk.
In "Souvenirs d'un homme de lettres" (mille huit cent quatre-vingt-huit) and "Trente Ans de Paris" (mille huit cent quatre-vingt-huit) Daudet tells the story of his life and literary activity.
It is through these works that we become intimately acquainted with our author, and we are not disillusioned.
"Entre les frises et la rampe" (mille huit cent quatre-vingt-treize) contains studies of the stage and its people.
Daudet claimed to be an independent, and was indignant when an attempt was made to class him with any school.
He was certainly independent in his youth, but in his second period, after the war, he became a realist with Flaubert and Zola and an impressionist with Goncourt.
[Footnote un: He consistently refused to have his name placed in candidacy before the Academy.
In a foreword prefixed to "L'Immortel" he declares: "Je ne me presente pas, je ne me suis jamais presente, je ne me presenterai jamais a l'Academie."] It is, however, the southerner in Daudet that remains most pleasing.
It is in those works which are directly inspired by his native land of dreams that he is most completely himself, and therefore most charming.
It is here that he discloses his kinship with Musset.
Surely it would have been better if he had never gone to Paris, but, like his friend Mistral, had remained in Provence and devoted his essentially poetic genius to an expression of the spirit of the south.
His keenly sensitive nature was too delicate for intercourse with the virility of a Zola or the subtlety of a Goncourt.
Paris made of him a realist, and the world lost by the transformation.
Daudet's love for his native land was intense.
Its images were ever present to him; its poetry haunted him throughout his life.
He urged young men ambitious of literary laurels to remain in their native provinces, to draw their inspiration from the soil, confident that something great and beautiful would result.
He was aware of this himself.
"un believe that I shall carry away with me," he said, "many curious observations on my race, its virtues, its faults".
cent quatre-vingt-trois; read the whole chapter.
"En lisant Eugenie de Guerin, je m'ecrie: 'Pourquoi n'avoir pas tous vecu chez nous, dans nos coins?' Comme nos esprits y auraient gagne au point de vue de l'originalite au sens etymologique du mot, c'est-a-dire vertu d'origine."--"Notes sur la vie," p.
cent quarante et un.] Daudet's remarkable power of observation was innate.
From his youth he exercised this instinct and carried a notebook in which he set down impressions, studies, and sketches of characters  and scenes.
These notebooks proved to be of inestimable value to the realist; and the natural inclination to seek the naked truth, to which they bear witness, strengthened the determination of the postbellum Daudet to enter the ranks of the sociological novelists.
So far as possible, he borrowed every detail of character and environment from real life; almost all his characters represent real persons whom he studied with a view of using them in his books.
Sadness is the prevailing tone in his work, the sort of sadness that proceeds from pity.
Where sadness does not dominate in Daudet, irony takes its place.
Paris, the war, his intercourse with Flaubert and Goncourt and Zola, were the influences, then, that transformed Daudet, most easily susceptible to impressions from without.
The Daudet of the great novels is not the real Daudet, however; the real Daudet is the author of "Les Amoureuses," of the "Lettres de mon moulin," and of "Tartarin de Tarascon." But even in the "Tartarin" series he is not entirely himself.
The pure stream of his native simplicity and naivete is already  tinged with the worldly-wiseness of the Parisian.
In the "Lettres de mon moulin" the writer is still in sympathy with his native land, while in the earliest of the "Tartarin" series, "Tartarin de Tarascon," there is already a spirit of disdainful raillery which Daudet learned in Paris.
Tarascon was piqued when "Tartarin de Tarascon" appeared.
Indeed, there is more than a little in the book that may well offend local pride.
In "Numa Roumestan" the satire is still less sympathetic and less good-natured.
Numa is utterly detestable.
He is a visionary; we readily forgive such a weakness, and we are amused by this characteristic trait of the south in Bompard and Tartarin.
These two are visionaries and liars; they are cowards too, boastful and conceited.
But they have never had the happiness of others in their hands.
If a true child of the south, such as Tartarin or Bompard, were placed in a position of trust, he would not prove equal to the occasion and the result would be a Numa Roumestan.
That is Daudet's verdict, and certainly his decision is not flattering to the south.
Le Quesnoy, the worthy northerner, deceives his wife as does Numa, the lying southerner.
The spirit of the novel is epitomized in such sentiments as "Joie de rue, douleur de maison," "Au nord au midi--tous pareils, traitres et parjures," "Grand homme pour tout le monde excepte pour sa femme." A decided pessimism pervades the great novels.
Optimistic  Daudet is frequently said to be.
He was truly so by nature, he is so in the "Lettres de mon moulin" and in all his work before the war, but his pessimism is unquestionable in the great novels.
Surely nature did not intend Daudet to become a pessimist; he loved mankind, he had many devoted friends and no enemies.
He carried happiness wherever he went.
The attic of Auteuil, the rendezvous of the Goncourt group, is dark and gloomy.
A serious, mirthless band surrounds the armchair of the patriarch.
The door opens and Daudet enters.
Old Goncourt rises to greet him: "Eh bien! mon petit, ca va?" "Assez bien, mon Goncourt" is the reply.
The terrible malady has already seized the younger man, but he still radiates life and cheer: his lightness of heart dispels the gravity of the company; little by little his animation is communicated to them all, and the attic resounds with peals of laughter.
It was always so.
The sympathy of Daudet, the man, was unfailing; his pity For the weak, his love for his family and friends, his hatred of villainy, were boundless.
He delighted in little acts of charity the source of which remained unknown to the world and even to the recipient.
"My father said to me again and again," Leon Daudet tells us, "un should like, after un have accomplished my task, to set myself up as a merchant of happiness.
We are told the story of the publication of "Tartarin de Tarascon"  by Daudet himself in his "Trente Ans de Paris." It began to appear in the Petit Moniteur universel, but did not appeal to the readers of this popular newspaper.
[Footnote un: The other books of the "Tartarin" series are inferior to "Tartarin de Tarascon" (mille huit cent soixante-douze).
"Tartarin sur les Alpes" (mille huit cent quatre-vingt-cinq) relates the adventures of the hero while climbing the great mountains of Switzerland in order to prove that he is worthy of remaming P.C.A.
(President du Club Alpin de Tarascon.) In "La Defense de Tarascon" (mille huit cent quatre-vingt-six, only a dozen pages long) we have a characteristic picture of the city preparing to resist the German invasion.
"Port-Tarascon" (mille huit cent quatre-vingt-dix) is the last and poorest of the series.
Tartarin leads his compatriots in a colonizing expedition to the South Seas, and then brings them home again.
Finally, in self-inflicted exile, "across the bridge" in Beaucaire (cf.
note to treize vingt-huit), the great man dies.] Publication was interrupted after some ten installments, and the work was carried to the Figaro, by whose more aristocratic clientele literary irony was not unappreciated.
The hero was first called Chapatin, then Barbarin (cf.
note to cinquante-six douze), and finally Tartarin.
"Tartarin de Tarascon" is a galejado, une plaisanterie, un eclat de rire.
Of all his creations Tartarin is the most widely known, and the world's conception of a French southerner is derived from the portrait of this hero.
As is usual in the works of Daudet, the character of Tartarin is not wholly fictitious.
The home of the cap-hunters was really not Tarascon, but a village five or six leagues away on the other side of the Rhone.
It was from this village, and in company with the prototype of Tartarin, that Daudet set out for Africa in mille huit cent soixante et un, chiefly to recover his health and incidentally to hunt lions.
The novel is a souvenir of the author's sojourn in the home of the real Tartarin and of the trip which the two made together, the whole being greatly modified by the play of the novelist's Provencal imagination.
[Footnote un: See the following notes of this edition for evidence of the extent to which Daudet used the notes jotted down in Africa in the composition of "Tartarin": soixante-dix vingt et un, soixante-treize vingt-sept, quatre-vingt-un cinq-six.
See also "Souvenirs d'un homme de lettres," p.
quarante-quatre, where he speaks of the notebook from which he extracted "Tartarin" and other works.] To appreciate "Tartarin de Tarascon" is not easy for a foreigner; and by foreigners is meant all those who have not lived in and do not know Provence.
Americans and Parisians (see pages seize-dix-sept) look on Tartarin and his compatriots as mere liars.
They are not liars: they are suffering simply from the effects of a mirage.
To understand what is meant by a mirage, you must go to the south of France.
There you will find a magic sun which transforms everything, which takes a molehill and makes of it a mountain.
Go to Tarascon, seek out a man who almost went to Shanghai, look steadfastly at him, and if the southern sun is shining upon him you will soon be convinced that he has actually gone to Shanghai.
In reading "Tartarin de Tarascon," therefore, remember that Tartarin's world is small and his imagination large; that he never lies, though he rarely tells the truth.
Do not make the mistake of thinking Tartarin a lunatic.
Just as his immortal predecessor Don Quixote was thoroughly sane except in that which touched the realm of chivalry, so Tartarin is a normal Frenchman except when he is under the influence of the southern mirage.
Daudet says in "Trente Ans de Paris," page cent quarante-deux, that the home of the real Tartarin was five or six miles from Tarascon on the other side of the Rhone.
Mistral said that the real Tartarin lived at Nimes, eighteen miles from Tarascon, to the west of the Rhone, and was no other than Raynaud, Daudet's own cousin.

Page un Ma premiere visite a Tartarin de Tarascon est restee dans ma vie comme une date inoubliable; il y a douze ou quinze ans de cela, mais je m'en souviens mieux que d'hier.
L'intrepide Tartarin habitait alors, a l'entree de la ville, la troisieme maison a main gauche sur le chemin d'Avignon.
Jolie petite villa tarasconnaise avec jardin devant, balcon derriere, des murs tres blancs, des persiennes vertes, et sur le pas de la porte une nichee de petits Savoyards jouant a la marelle ou dormant au bon soleil, la tete sur leurs boites a cirage.
Du dehors, la maison n'avait l'air de rien.
Jamais on ne se serait cru devant la demeure d'un heros.
Mais quand on entrait, coquin de sort!...
De la cave au grenier, tout le batiment avait l'air heroique, meme le jardin!...
O le jardin de Tartarin, il n'y en avait pas deux comme celui-la en Europe.
Pas un arbre du pays, pas une fleur de France; rien que des plantes exotiques, des gommiers, des calebassiers, des cotonniers, des cocotiers, des manguiers, des bananiers, des Page deux.
palmiers, un baobab, des nopals, des cactus, des figuiers de Barbarie, a se croire en pleine Afrique centrale, a dix mille lieues de Tarascon.
Pensez quelle emotion je dus eprouver ce jour-la en traversant ce jardin mirifique!...
Ce fut bien autre chose quand on m'introduisit dans le cabinet du heros.
Ce cabinet, une des curiosites de la ville, etait au fond du jardin, ouvrant de plain-pied sur le baobab par une porte vitree.
Ce qui rassurait un peu pourtant, c'etait le bon air d'ordre et de proprete qui regnait sur toute cette yataganerie.
Tout y etait range, soigne, brosse, etiquete comme dans une pharmacie; de loin en loin, un petit ecriteau bonhomme sur lequel on lisait: Fleches empoisonnees, n'y touchez pas! Ou: Armes chargees, mefiez-vous! Sans ces ecriteaux, jamais je n'aurais ose entrer.
Page trois Au milieu du cabinet, il y avait un gueridon.
Sur le gueridon, un flacon de rhum, une blague turque, les Voyages du capitaine Cook, les romans de Cooper, de Gustave Aimard, des recits de chasse a l'ours, chasse au faucon, chasse a l'elephant, Etc....
Cet homme, c'etait Tartarin, Tartarin de Tarascon, l'intrepide, le grand, l'incomparable Tartarin de Tarascon.
Coup d'oeil general jete sur la bonne ville de Tarascon; les chasseurs de casquettes.
Au temps dont je vous parle, Tartarin de Tarascon n'etait pas encore le Tartarin qu'il est aujourd'hui, le grand Tartarin de Tarascon, si populaire dans tout le midi de la France.
Pourtant --meme a cette epoque--c'etait deja le roi de Tarascon.
Disons d'ou lui venait cette royaute.
Vous saurez d'abord que la-bas tout le monde est chasseur, depuis le plus grand jusqu'au plus petit.
La chasse est la passion des Tarasconnais, et cela depuis les temps mythologiques ou la Tarasque faisait les cent coups dans les marais de la ville et ou les Tarasconnais d'alors organisaient des battues contre elle.
Il y a beau jour, comme vous voyez.
Page quatre Donc, tous les dimanches matin, Tarascon prend les armes et sort de ses murs, le sac au dos, le fusil sur l'epaule, avec un tremblement de chiens, de furets, de trompes, de cors de chasse.
C'est superbe a voir....
Par malheur, le gibier manque, il manque absolument.
Si betes que soient les betes, vous pensez bien qu'a la longue elles ont fini par se mefier.
A cinq lieues autour de Tarascon, les terriers sont vides, les nids abandonnes.
Pas un merle, pas une caille, pas le moindre lapereau, pas le plus petit cul-blanc.
Elles sont cependant bien tentantes, ces jolies collinettes tarasconnaises, toutes parfumees de myrte, de lavande, de romarin; et ces beaux raisins muscats gonfles de sucre, qui s'echelonnent an bord du Rhone, sont diablement appetissants aussi....
Oui, mais il y a Tarascon derriere, et dans le petit monde du poil et de la plume, Tarascon est tres mal note.
voila Tarascon!" et toute la bande fait un crochet.
Bref, en fait de gibier, il ne reste plus dans le pays qu'un vieux coquin de lievre, echappe comme par miracle aux septembrisades tarasconnaises et qui s'entete a vivre la! A Tarascon, ce lievre est tres connu.
On lui a donne un nom.
Il s'appelle le Rapide.
On sait qu'il a son gite dans la terre de Monsieur Bompard,--ce qui, par parenthese, a double et meme triple le prix de cette terre,--mais on n'a pas encore pu l'atteindre.
A l'heure qu'il est meme, il n'y a plus que deux ou trois enrages qui s'acharnent apres lui.
Les autres en ont fait leur deuil, et le Rapide est passe depuis longtemps a l'etat de superstition locale, bien que le Tarasconnais Page cinq soit tres peu superstitieux de sa nature et qu'il mange les hirondelles en salmis, quand il en trouve.
--Ah ca! me direz-vous, puisque le gibier est si rare a Tarascon, qu'est-ce que les chasseurs tarasconnais font donc tous les dimanches? Ce qu'ils font? Eh mon Dieu! ils s'en vont en pleine campagne, a deux ou trois lieues de la ville.
Apres quoi, quand on est bien leste, on se leve, on siffle les chiens, on arme les fusils, et on se met en chasse.
C'est a dire que chacun de ces messieurs prend sa casquette, la jette en l'air de toutes ses forces, et la tire au vol avec du cinq, du six, ou du deux,--selon les conventions.
Celui qui met le plus souvent dans sa casquette est proclame roi de la chasse, et rentre le soir en triomphateur a Tarascon, la casquette criblee au bout du fusil, au milieu des aboiements et des fanfares.
Inutile de vous dire qu'il se fait dans la ville un grand commerce de casquettes de chasse.
Il y a meme des chapeliers qui vendent des casquettes trouees et dechirees d'avance a l'usage des maladroits, mais on ne connait guere que Bezuquet, le pharmacien, qui leur en achete.
C'est deshonorant! Comme chasseur de casquettes, Tartarin de Tarascon n'avait pas son pareil.
Tous les dimanches matin, il partait avec une casquette neuve: tous les dimanches soir, il revenait avec une loque.
Dans la petite maison du baobab, les greniers etaient pleins de ces glorieux trophees.
Tous les jours, de trois a quatre, chez un'armurier Costecalde on voyait un gros homme, grave et la pipe aux dents, assis sur un fauteuil de cuir vert, au milieu de la boutique pleine de chasseurs de casquettes, tous debout et se chamaillant.
C'etait Tartarin de Tarascon qui rendait la justice, Nemrod double de Salomon.
Nan! Nan! Nan! Suite du coup d'oeil general jete sur la bonne ville de Tarascon.
A la passion de la chasse, la forte race tarasconnaise joint une autre passion: celle des romances.
Ce qui se consomme de romances dans ce petit pays, c'est a n'y pas croire.
Toutes les vieilleries sentimentales qui jaunissent dans les plus vieux cartons, on les retrouve a Tarascon en pleine jeunesse, en plein eclat.
Elles y sont toutes, toutes.
Chaque famille a la sienne, et dans la ville cela se sait.
On sait, par exemple, que celle du pharmacien Bezuquet, c'est:       Toi, blanche etoile que j'adore; Celle de l'armurier Costecalde: Celle du receveur de l'enregistrement: Page sept Et ainsi de suite pour tout Tarascon.
Deux ou trois fois par semaine, on se reunit les uns chez les autres et on se les chante.
Ce qu'il y a de singulier, c'est que ce sont toujours les memes, et que, depuis si longtemps qu'ils se les chantent, ces braves Tarasconnais n'ont jamais envie d'en changer.
On se les legue dans les familles, de pere en fils, et personne n'y touche; c'est sacre.
Jamais meme on ne s'en emprunte.
Jamais il ne viendrait a l'idee des Costecalde de chanter celle des Bezuquet, ni aux Bezuquet de chanter celle des Costecalde.
Et pourtant vous pensez s'ils doivent les connaitre depuis quarante ans qu'ils se les chantent.
Mais non! chacun garde la sienne et tout le monde est content.
Pour les romances comme pour les casquettes, le premier de la ville etait encore Tartarin.
Sa superiorite sur ses concitoyens consistait en ceci: Tartarin de Tarascon n'avait pas la sienne.
Il les avait toutes.
Toutes! Seulement c'etait le diable pour les lui faire chanter.
Revenu de bonne heure des succes de salon, le heros tarasconnais aimait bien mieux se plonger dans ses livres de chasse ou passer sa soiree au cercle que de faire le joli coeur devant un piano de Nimes, entre deux bougies de Tarascon.
Ces parades musicales lui semblaient au-dessous de lui....
Quelquefois cependant, quand il y avait de la musique a la pharmacie Bezuquet, il entrait comme par hasard, et apres s'etre bien fait prier, consentait a dire le grand duo de Robert le Diable, avec madame Bezuquet la mere....
Qui n'a pas entendu cela n'a jamais rien entendu....
A peine avait-il pris position, tout de suite le salon fremissait; Page huit on sentait qu'il allait se passer quelque chose de grand....
non!...
non!..." ce qu'en bon Meridional il prononcait: "Nan!...
nan!...
nan!..." Sur quoi madame Bezuquet la mere reprenait encore une fois: --"Nan!...
nan!...
nan!..." hurlait Tartarin de plus belle, et la chose en restait la....
Ce n'etait pas long, comme vous voyez: mais c'etait si bien jete, si bien mime, si diabolique, qu'un frisson de terreur courait dans la pharmacie, et qu'on lui faisait recommencer ses: "Nan!...
nan!" quatre et cinq fois de suite.
Ils!!! Page neuf C'est a ces differents talents que Tartarin de Tarascon devait sa haute situation dans la ville.
Du reste, c'est une chose positive que ce diable d'homme avait su prendre tout le monde.
A Tarascon, l'armee etait pour Tartarin.
Le brave commandant Bravida, capitaine d'habillement en retraite, disait de lui: "C'est un lapin!" et vous pensez que le commandant s'y connaissait en lapins, apres en avoir tant habille.
La magistrature etait pour Tartarin.
Deux ou trois fois, en plein tribunal, le vieux president Ladeveze avait dit, parlant de lui: "C'est un caractere!" Enfin le peuple etait pour Tartarin.
Le grand homme de Tarascon s'ennuyait a Tarascon.
Pauvre cher grand homme! A la longue, Il y aurait eu de quoi le faire mourir de consomption.
Helas! tout ce qu'il faisait pour apaiser sa soif d'aventures ne servait qu'a l'augmenter.
La vue de toutes ses armes l'entretenait dans un etat perpetuel de colere et d'excitation.
Ses rifles, ses fleches, ses lazos lui criaient: "Bataille! bataille!" Dans les branches de son baobab, le vent des grands voyages soufflait et lui donnait de mauvais conseils.
Pour l'achever, Gustave Aimard et Fenimore Cooper....
Ils! c'etait tout ce qui attaque, tout ce qui combat, tout ce qui mord, tout Page onze ce qui griffe, tout ce qui scalpe, tout ce qui hurle, tout ce qui rugit....
Ils! c'etait un'Indien Sioux dansant autour du poteau de guerre ou le malheureux blanc est attache.
C'etait l'ours gris des montagnes Rocheuses qui se dandine, et qui se leche avec une langue pleine de sang.
C'etait encore le Touareg du desert, le pirate malais, le bandit des Abruzzes....
Ils enfin, c'etait ils! ...
c'est-a-dire la guerre, les voyages, l'aventure, la gloire.
Mais, helas! un'intrepide Tarasconnais avait beau les appeler, les defier ...
ils ne venaient jamais....
Pecaire! qu'est-ce qu'ils seraient venus faire a Tarascon? Tartarin cependant les attendait toujours;--surtout le soir en allant au cercle.
Quand Tartarin allait au cercle.
Branle-has de combat! comme disent les matelots.
A la main gauche, Tartarin prenait un coup-de-poing a pointes de fer, a la main droite une canne a epee; dans la poche gauche, un casse-tete; dans la poche droite, un revolver.
Sur la poitrine, entre drap et flanelle, un krish malais.
Par exemple, jamais de fleche empoisonnee; ce sont des armes trop deloyales!...
Il l'ouvrait brusquement, violemment, de facon a ce qu'elle allat battre en dehors contre la muraille....
S'ils avaient ete derriere, vous pensez quelle marmelade!...
Malheureusement, ils n'etaient pas derriere.
La porte ouverte, Tartarin sortait, jetait vite un coup d'oeil de droite et de gauche, fermait la porte a double tour et vivement.
Puis en route.
Sur le chemin d'Avignon, pas un chat.
Portes closes, fenetres eteintes.
Tout etait noir.
De loin en loin un reverbere, clignotant dans le brouillard du Rhone....
Superbe et calme, Tartarin de Tarascon s'en allait ainsi dans la nuit, faisant sonner ses talons en mesure, et du bout ferre de sa canne arrachant des etincelles aux paves....
Boulevards, grandes rues ou ruelles, il avait soin de tenir toujours le milieu de la chaussee, excellente mesure de precaution qui vous permet de voir venir le danger, et surtout d'eviter ce qui, le soir, dans les rues de Tarascon, tombe quelquefois des fenetres.
A lui voir tant de prudence, n'allez pas croire au moins que Tartarin eut peur....
Non! seulement il se gardait.
Le pauvre homme esperait toujours qu'au detour d'un de ces coupe-gorge ils allaient s'elancer de un'ombre et lui tomber sur le dos.
Ils auraient ete bien recus, je vous en reponds....
Mais, helas! par une derision du destin, jamais, au grand jamais, Tartarin de Tarascon n'eut la chance de faire une mauvaise rencontre.
Pas meme un chien, pas meme un ivrogne.
Rien! Parfois cependant une fausse alerte.
Un bruit de pas, des voix Etouffees....
"Attention!" se disait Tartarin, et il restait plante sur place, scrutant un'ombre, prenant le vent, appuyant son oreille contre terre a la mode indienne....
Les pas approchaient.
Page treize Les voix devenaient distinctes....
Plus de doutes! Ils arrivaient....
Ils etaient la.
 Deja Tartarin, l'oeil en feu, la poitrine haletante, se ramassait sur lui-meme comme un jaguar, et se preparait a bondir en poussant son cri de guerre ...
quand tout a coup, du sein de l'ombre, il entendait de bonnes voix tarasconnaises l'appeler bien tranquillement: "Te! ve! ...
c'est Tartarin....
Et adieu, Tartarin!" Malediction! c'etait le pharmacien Bezuquet avec sa famille qui venait de chanter la sienne chez les Costecalde.--"Bonsoir! bonsoir!" grommelait Tartarin, furieux de sa meprise, et, farouche, la canne haute, il s'enfoncait dans la nuit.
Arrive dans la rue du cercle, l'intrepide Tarasconnais attendait encore un moment en se promenant de long en large devant la porte avant d'entrer....
A la fin, las de les attendre et certain qu'ils ne se montreraient pas, il jetait un dernier regard de defi dans l'ombre, et murmurait avec colere: "Rien!...
rien!...
jamais rien!" La-dessus le brave homme entrait faire son besigue avec le commandant.
Les deux Tartarins.
Avec cette rage d'aventures, ce besoin d'emotions fortes, cette folie de voyages, de courses, de diable au vert, comment diantre se trouvait-il que Tartarin de Tarascon n'eut jamais quitte Tarascon? Car c'est un fait.
Jusqu'a l'age de quarante-cinq ans, l'intrepide Tarasconnais n'avait pas une fois couche hors de sa ville.
Il n'avait pas meme fait ce fameux voyage a Marseille, que tout bon Provencal se paie a sa majorite.
Tartarin de Tarascon preferait la terre ferme.
C'est qu'il faut bien vous l'avouer, il y avait dans notre heros deux natures tres distinctes.
"Je sens deux hommes en moi", a dit je ne sais quel Pere de l'Eglise.
Le corps de Tartarin, au contraire, etait un brave homme de corps, tres gras, tres lourd, tres sensuel, tres douillet, tres geignard, plein d'appetits bourgeois et d'exigences domestiques, le corps ventru et court sur pattes de l'immortel Sancho Panca.
Don Quichotte et Sancho Panca dans le meme homme! vous comprenez quel mauvais menage ils y devaient faire! quels combats! quels dechirements!...
TARTARIN-SANCHO, tres calme: Tartarin, couvre-toi de flanelle.
La-dessus Jeannette apparait avec un excellent chocolat, chaud, moire, parfume, et de succulentes grillades a l'anis, qui font rire Tartarin-Sancho en etouffant les cris de Tartarin-Quichotte.
Et voila comme il se trouvait que Tartarin de Tarascon n'eut jamais quitte Tarascon.
Les Europeens a Shang-Hai.
Le Haut Commerce.
Les Tartares.
Tartarin de Tarascon serait-il un imposteur? Le mirage.
Une fois cependant Tartarin avait failli partir, partir pour un grand voyage.
Les trois freres Garcio-Camus, des Tarasconnais etablis a Shang-Hai, lui avaient offert la direction d'un de leurs comptoirs la-bas.
Ca, par exemple, c'etait bien la vie qu'il lui fallait.
Des affaires considerables, tout un monde de commis a gouverner, des relations avec la Russie, la Perse, la Turquie d'Asie, enfin le Haut Commerce.
Dans la bouche de Tartarin, ce mot de Haut Commerce vous apparaissait d'une hauteur!...
La maison de Garcio-Camus avait en outre cet avantage qu'on y recevait quelquefois la visite des Tartares.
Alors vite on fermait les portes.
Tous les commis prenaient les armes, on Page seize hissait le drapeau consulaire, et pan! pan! par les fenetres sur les Tartares.
Avec quel enthousiasme Tartarin-Quichotte sauta sur cette proposition, je n'ai pas besoin de vous le dire; par malheur Tartarin Sancho n'entendait pas de cette oreille la, et, comme il etait le plus fort, l'affaire ne put pas s'arranger.
Dans la ville on en parla beaucoup.
Partira-t-il? ne partira-t-il pas? Parions que si, parions que non.
Ce fut un evenement....
En fin de compte, Tartarin ne partit pas, mais toutefois cette histoire lui fit beaucoup d'honneur.
Avoir failli aller a Shang-Hai ou y etre alle, pour Tarascon, c'etait tout comme.
A force de parler du voyage de Tartarin, on finit par croire qu'il en revenait, et le soir, au cercle, tous ces messieurs lui demandaient des renseignements sur la vie a Shang-Hai, sur les moeurs, le climat, l'opium, le Haut Commerce.
--Mais alors, votre Tartarin n'etait qu'un affreux menteur.
--Non! mille fois non! Tartarin n'etait pas un menteur....
--Pourtant, il devait bien savoir qu'il n'etait pas alle a Shang-Hai! --Eh! sans doute, il le savait.
Seulement....
Seulement, ecoutez bien ceci.
Il est temps de s'entendre une fois pour toutes sur cette reputation de menteurs que les gens du Nord ont faite aux Meridionaux.
Il n'y a pas de menteurs dans le Midi, pas plus a Marseille qu'a Nimes, qu'a Toulouse qu'a Tarascon.
L'homme du Midi ne ment pas, il se trompe.
Page dix-sept Il ne dit pas toujours la verite, mais il croit la dire....
Son mensonge a lui, ce n'est pas du mensonge, c'est une espece de mirage....
Oui, du mirage!...
Et pour bien me comprendre, allez-vous-en dans le Midi, et vous verrez.
Vous verrez ce diable de pays ou le soleil transfigure tout, et fait tout plus grand que nature.
Vous verrez ces petites collines de Provence pas plus hautes que la butte Montmartre et qui vous paraitront gigantesques, vous verrez la Maison carree de Nimes,--un petit bijou d'etagere, --qui vous semblera aussi grande que Notre-Dame.
Vous verrez.
Ah! le seul menteur du Midi, s'il y en a un, c'est le Soleil....
Tout ce qu'il touche, il l'exagere!...
Qu'est-ce que c'etait que Sparte aux temps de sa splendeur? Une bourgade.
Qu'est ce que c'etait qu'Athenes? Tout au plus une sous-prefecture ...
et pourtant dans l'histoire elles nous apparaissent comme des villes enormes.
Voila ce que le soleil en a fait....
Un lion de l'Atlas a Tarascon.
Terrible et solennelle entrevue.
C'etait un soir, chez l'armurier Costecalde.
Tartarin de Tarascon etait en train de demontrer a quelques amateurs le maniement du fusil a aiguille, alors dans toute sa nouveaute....
Soudain la porte s'ouvre, et un chasseur de casquettes se precipite effare dans la boutique, en criant: "Un lion!...
un lion!..." Stupeur generale, effroi, tumulte, bousculade.
Tartarin croise la baionnette, Costecalde court fermer la porte.
Un lion de l'Atlas a Tarascon! Jamais, de memoire d'homme, pareille chose ne s'etait vue.
Pas meme Tartarin.
Pale et fremissant, le fusil a aiguille encore entre les mains, il songeait debout devant le comptoir....
Un lion, mille dieux!...
Et de l'Atlas encore!!! C'etait plus que le grand Tartarin n'en pouvait supporter....
Tout a coup un paquet de sang lui monta au visage.
Page dix-neuf Ses yeux flamberent.
D'un geste convulsif il jeta le fusil a aiguille sur son epaule, et, se tournant vers le brave commandant Bravida, ancien capitaine d'habillement, il lui dit d'une voix de tonnerre: "Allons voir ca, commandant." --"He! be ...
he! be ...
Et mon fusil!...
mon fusil a aiguille que vous emportez!..." hasarda timidement le prudent Costecalde; mais Tartarin avait tourne la rue, et derriere lui tous les chasseurs de casquettes emboitant fierement le pas.
Quand ils arriverent a la menagerie, il y avait deja beaucoup de monde.
Tarascon, race heroique, mais trop longtemps privee de spectacles a sensations, s'etait rue sur la baraque Mitaine et l'avait prise d'assaut.
Aussi la grosse madame Mitaine etait bien contente....
L'entree de Tartarin, le fusil sur l'epaule, jeta un froid.
Tous ces braves Tarasconnais, qui se promenaient bien tranquillement devant les cages, sans armes, sans mefiance, sans meme aucune idee de danger, eurent un mouvement de terreur assez naturel en voyant leur grand Tartarin entrer dans la baraque avec son formidable engin de guerre.
Il y avait donc quelque chose a craindre, puisque lui, ce heros....
En un clin d'oeil, tout le devant des cages se trouva degarni.
Les enfants criaient de peur, les dames regardaient la porte.
Le pharmacien Bezuquet s'esquiva, en disant qu'il allait chercher son fusil....
Peu a peu cependant, l'attitude de Tartarin rassura les courages.
Terrible et solennelle entrevue! le lion de Tarascon et le lion de l'Atlas en face l'un de l'autre....
D'un cote, Tartarin, debout, le jarret tendu, les deux bras appuyes sur son rifle; de l'autre, le lion, un lion gigantesque, vautre dans la paille, l'oeil clignotant, l'air abruti, avec son enorme mufle a perruque jaune pose sur les pattes de devant....
Tous deux calmes et se regardant.
D'abord il renifla, gronda sourdement, ecarta ses griffes, etira ses pattes; puis il se leva, dressa la tete, secoua sa criniere, ouvrit une gueule immense et poussa vers Tartarin un formidable rugissement.
Un cri de terreur lui repondit.
Tarascon, affole, se precipita vers les portes.
Tous, femmes, enfants, portefaix, chasseurs de casquettes, le brave commandant Bravida lui-meme....
Seul, Tartarin de Tarascon ne bougea pas....
Il etait la, ferme et resolu, devant la cage, des eclairs dans les yeux et cette terrible moue que toute la ville connaissait....
Singuliers effets du mirage.
Page vingt et un Ce jour-la, Tartarin de Tarascon n'en dit pas davantage; mais le malheureux en avait deja trop dit....
Le lendemain, il n'etait bruit dans la ville que du prochain depart de Tartarin pour l'Algerie et la chasse aux lions.
Vous etes tous temoins, chers lecteurs, que le brave homme n'avait pas souffle mot de cela; mais vous savez, le mirage....
Bref, tout Tarascon ne parlait que de ce depart.
Sur le cours, au cercle, chez Costecalde, les gens s'abordaient d'un air effare: "Et autrement, vous savez la nouvelle, au moins? --Et autrement, quoi donc?...
le depart de Tartarin, au moins?" Car a Tarascon toutes les phrases commencent par et autrement, qu'on prononce autremain, et finissent par au moins, qu'on prononce an mouain.
Or, ce jour-la, plus que tous les autres, les au mouain et les autremain sonnaient a faire trembler les vitres.
L'homme le plus surpris de la ville, en apprenant qu'il allait partir pour l'Afrique, ce fut Tartarin.
Mais voyez ce que c'est que la vanite! Au lieu de repondre simplement qu'il ne partait pas du tout, qu'il n'avait jamais eu l'intention de partir, le pauvre Tartarin--la premiere fois qu'on lui parla de ce voyage--fit d'un petit air evasif: "He!...
he!...
peut-etre ...
Un hourra formidable accueillit cette declaration.
La-dessus, nouveau punch aux oeufs, poignees de mains, accolades et serenade aux flambeaux jusqu'a minuit devant la petite maison du baobab.
En vain Tartarin-Quichotte jurait-il de ne pas faire d'imprudences, qu'il se couvrirait bien, qu'il emporterait tout ce qu'il faudrait, Tartarin-Sancho ne voulait rien entendre.
Il est bien clair, en effet, que l'on ne s'embarque pas pour une expedition semblable sans prendre quelques precautions Il faut savoir ou l'on va, que diable! et ne pas partir comme un oiseau....
Avant toutes choses, le Tarasconnais voulut lire les recits des grands touristes africains, les relations de Mungo-Park, de Caille, du docteur Livingstone, d'Henri Duveyrier.
La, il vit que ces intrepides voyageurs, avant de chausser leurs sandales pour les excursions lointaines, s'etaient prepares de Page vingt-trois longue main a supporter la faim, la soif, les marches forcees, les privations de toutes sortes.
Tartarin voulut faire comme eux, et, a partir de ce jour-la, ne se nourrit plus que d'eau bouillie.
--Ce qu'on appelle eau bouillie, a Tarascon, c'est quelques tranches de pain noyees dans de l'eau chaude, avec une gousse d'ail, un peu de thym, un brin de laurier.--Le regime etait severe, et vous pensez si le pauvre Sancho fit la grimace....
A l'entrainement par l'eau bouillie Tartarin de Tarascon joignit d'autres sages pratiques.
Puis, pour se faire aux fraicheurs nocturnes, aux brouillards, a la rosee, il descendait tous les soirs dans son jardin et restait la jusqu'a des dix et onze heures, seul avec son fusil, a l'affut derriere le baobab....
Enfin, tant que la menagerie Mitaine resta a Tarascon, les chasseurs de casquettes attardes chez Costecalde purent voir dans l'ombre, en passant sur la place du Chateau, un homme mysterieux se promenant de long en large derriere la baraque.
C'etait Tartarin de Tarascon, qui s'habituait a entendre sans fremir les rugissements du lion dans la nuit sombre.
Avant le depart.
Pendant que Tartarin s'entrainait ainsi par toute sorte de moyens heroiques, tout Tarascon avait les yeux sur lui; on ne s'occupait plus d'autre chose.
La chasse a la casquette ne battait plus que d'une aile, les romances chomaient.
Dans la pharmacie Bezuquet le piano languissait sous une housse verte, et Page vingt-quatre les mouches cantharides sechaient dessus, le ventre en l'air....
L'expedition de Tartarin avait arrete tout.
Il fallait voir le succes du Tarasconnais dans les salons.
On se l'arrachait, on se le disputait, on se l'empruntait, on se le volait.
Tartarin donnait toutes les explications qu'on voulait.
Il avait lu Jules Gerard et connaissait la chasse au lion sur le bout du doigt, comme s'il l'avait faite.
Aussi parlait-il de ces choses avec une grande eloquence.
Mais ou il etait le plus beau, c'etait le soir a diner chez le president Ladeveze ou le brave commandant Bravida, ancien capitaine d'habillement, quand on apportait le cafe et que, toutes les chaises se rapprochant, on le faisait parler de ses chasses futures....
Alors, le coude sur la nappe, le nez dans son moka, le heros racontait d'une voix emue tous les dangers qui l'attendaient la-has.
Puis, s'exaltant a son propre recit, il se levait de table, bondissait au milieu de la salle a manger, imitant le cri du lion, le bruit d'une carabine, pan! pan! le sifflement d'une balle explosible, pfft! pfft! gesticulait, rugissait, renversait les chaises....
Autour de la table, tout le monde etait pale.
En attendant, Tartarin ne partait pas.
Des coups d'epee, Messieurs, des coups d'epee....
Mais pas de coups d'epingle! Avait-il bien reellement l'intention de partir?...
Question delicate, et a laquelle l'historien de Tartarin serait fort embarrasse de repondre.
Toujours est-il que la menagerie Mitaine avait quitte Tarascon depuis plus de trois mois, et le tueur de lions ne bougeait pas....
Apres tout, peut-etre le candide heros, aveugle par un nouveau mirage, se figurait-il de bonne foi qu'il etait alle en Algerie.
Peut-etre qu'a force de raconter ses futures chasses, il s'imaginait les avoir faites, aussi sincerement qu'il s'imaginait avoir hisse le drapeau consulaire et tire sur les Tartares, pan! pan! a Shang-Hai.
Malheureusement, si cette fois encore Tartarin de Tarascon fut victime du mirage, les Tarasconnais ne le furent pas.
Lorsqu'au bout de trois mois d'attente, on s'apercut que le chasseur n'avait pas encore fait une malle, on commenca a murmurer.
"Ce sera comme pour Shang-Hai!" disait Costecalde en souriant.
Et le mot de l'armurier fit fureur dans la ville; car personne ne croyait plus en Tartarin.
Les naifs, les poltrons, des gens comme Bezuquet, qu'une puce aurait mis en fuite et qui ne pouvaient pas tirer un coup de fusil sans fermer les yeux, ceux-la surtout etaient impitoyables.
Au cercle, sur l'esplanade, ils abordaient le pauvre Tartarin avec de petits airs goguenards.
Page vingt-sept "Et autremain, pour quand ce voyage?" Dans la boutique Costecalde, son opinion ne faisait plus foi.
Les chasseurs de casquettes reniaient leur chef! Puis les epigrammes s'en melerent.
Le president Ladeveze, qui faisait volontiers en ses heures de loisir deux doigts de cour a la muse provencale, composa dans la langue du cru une chanson qui eut beaucoup de succes.
Il etait question d'un certain grand chasseur appele maitre Gervais, dont le fusil redoutable devait exterminer jusqu'au dernier tous les lions d'Afrique.
Par malheur ce diable de fusil etait de complexion singuliere: on le chargeait toujours, il ne partait jamais.
Il ne partait jamais! vous comprenez l'allusion....
Seulement cela se chantait de loin, a cause des doubles muscles.
O fragilite des engouements de Tarascon!...
Le grand homme, lui, feignait de ne rien voir, de ne rien entendre; mais au fond cette petite guerre sourde et venimeuse l'affligeait beaucoup; il sentait Tarascon lui glisser dans la main, la faveur populaire aller a d'autres, et cela le faisait horriblement souffrir.
Ah! la grande gamelle de la popularite, il fait bon s'asseoir devant, mais quel echaudement quand elle se renverse!...
En depit de sa souffrance, Tartarin souriait et menait paisiblement sa meme vie, comme si de rien n'etait.
Quelquefois cependant ce masque de joyeuse insouciance, qu'il s'etait par fierte colle sur le visage, se detachait subitement.
Alors, au lieu du rire, on voyait l'indignation et la douleur....
Page vingt-huit C'est ainsi qu'un matin que les petits decrotteurs chantaient sous ses fenetres: Lou fusiou de mestre Gervai, les voix de ces miserables arriverent jusqu'a la chambre du pauvre grand homme en train de se raser devant sa glace.
Au milieu de la defection generale, l'armee seule tenait bon pour Tartarin.
Le brave commandant Bravida, ancien capitaine d'habillement, continuait a lui marquer la meme estime: "C'est un lapin!" s'entetait-il a dire, et cette affirmation valait bien, j'imagine, Celle du pharmacien Bezuquet....
Pas une fois le brave commandant n'avait fait allusion au voyage en Afrique; pourtant, quand la clameur publique devint trop forte, il se decida a parler.
Un soir, le malheureux Tartarin etait seul dans son cabinet, pensant a des choses tristes, quand il vit entrer le commandant, grave, gante de noir, boutonne jusqu'aux oreilles.
"Tartarin," fit l'ancien capitaine avec autorite, "Tartarin, il faut partir!" Et il restait debout dans l'encadrement de la porte, --rigide et grand comme le devoir.
Page vingt-neuf Tout ce qu'il y avait dans ce "Tartarin, il faut partir!" Tartarin de Tarascon le comprit.
Seulement pas encore tout de suite ...
il lui fallut le temps de s'outiller.
D'abord il commanda chez Bompard deux grandes malles doublees de cuivre, avec une longue plaque portant cette inscription: Le doublage et la gravure prirent beaucoup de temps.
Il commanda aussi chez Tastavin un magnifique album de voyage pour ecrire son journal, ses impressions, car enfin on a beau chasser le lion, on pense tout de meme en route.
Enfin le pharmacien Bezuquet lui confectionna une petite pharmacie portative bourree de sparadrap, d'arnica, de camphre, de vinaigre des quatre-voleurs.
Pauvre Tartarin! ce qu'il en faisait, ce n'etait pas pour lui; mais il esperait, a force de precautions et d'attentions delicates, apaiser la fureur de Tartarin-Sancho, qui, depuis que le depart etait decide, ne decolerait ni de jour ni de nuit.
Le depart.
Page trente Enfin il arriva, le jour solennel, le grand jour.
Des l'aube, tout Tarascon etait sur pied, encombrant le chemin d'Avignon et les abords de la petite maison du baobab.
Toute cette foule se pressait, se bousculait devant la porte de Tartarin, ce bon Monsieur Tartarin, qui s'en allait tuer des lions chez les Teurs.
Pour Tarascon, l'Algerie, l'Afrique, la Grece, la Perse, la Turquie, la Mesopotamie, tout cela forme un grand pays tres vague, presque mythologique, et cela s'appelle les Teurs (les Turcs).
Au milieu de cette cohue, les chasseurs de casquettes allaient et venaient, fiers du triomphe de leur chef, et tracant sur leur passage comme des sillons glorieux.
Devant la maison du baobab, deux grandes brouettes.
De temps en temps, la porte s'ouvrait, laissant voir quelques personnes qui se promenaient gravement dans le petit jardin.
Des hommes apportaient des malles, des caisses, des sacs de nuit, qu'ils empilaient sur les brouettes.
A chaque nouveau colis, la foule fremissait.
On se nommait les objets a haute voix.
"Ca, c'est la tente-abri....
Ca, ce Page trente sont les conserves ...
la pharmacie ...
les caisses d'armes...." Et les chasseurs de casquettes donnaient des explications.
Tout a coup, vers dix heures, il se fit un grand mouvement dans la foule.
La porte du jardin tourna sur ses gonds violemment.
"C'est lui! ...
c'est lui!" criait-on.
C'etait lui....
Quand il parut sur le seuil, deux cris de stupeur partirent de la foule: "C'est un Teur!...
--Il a des lunettes!" Tartarin de Tarascon, en effet, avait cru de son devoir, allant en Algerie, de prendre le costume algerien.
Large pantalon bouffant en toile blanche, petite veste collante a boutons de metal, deux pieds de ceinture rouge autour de l'estomac, le cou nu, le front rase, sur sa tete une gigantesque chechia (bonnet rouge) et un flot bleu d'une longueur!...
Avec cela, deux lourds fusils, un sur chaque epaule, un grand couteau de chasse a la ceinture, sur le ventre une cartouchiere, sur la hanche un revolver se balancant dans sa poche de cuir.
C'est tout....
Ah! pardon, j'oubliais les lunettes, une enorme paire de lunettes bleues qui venaient la bien a propos pour corriger ce qu'il y avait d'un pen trop farouche dans la tournure de notre heros! "Vive Tartarin! ...
vive Tartarin!" hurla le peuple.
Le grand homme sourit, mais ne salua pas, a cause de ses fusils qui le genaient.
Du reste, il savait maintenant a quoi s'en tenir sur la faveur populaire; peut-etre meme qu'au fond de son ame il maudissait ses terribles compatriotes, qui l'obligeaient a partir, a quitter son joli petit chez lui aux murs blancs, aux persiennes vertes....
Mais cela ne se voyait pas.
Calme et fier, quoiqu'un peu pale, il s'avanca sur la chaussee, regarda ses brouettes, et, voyant que tout etait bien, prit gaillardement le chemin de la gare, sans meme se retourner une Page trente et un fois vers la maison du baobab.
Derriere lui marchaient le brave commandant Bravida, ancien capitaine d'habillement, le president Ladeveze, puis l'armurier Costecalde et tous les chasseurs de casquettes, puis les brouettes, puis le peuple.
Devant l'embarcadere, le chef de gare l'attendait,--un vieil Africain de mille huit cent trente, qui lui serra la main plusieurs fois avec chaleur.
L'express Paris-Marseille n'etait pas encore arrive.
Tartarin et son etat-major entrerent dans les salles d'attente.
Pour eviter l'encombrement, derriere eux le chef de gare fit fermer les grilles.
Pendant un quart d'heure, Tartarin se promena de long en large dans les salles, au milieu des chasseurs de casquettes.
Il leur parlait de son voyage, de sa chasse, promettant d'envoyer des peaux.
On s'inscrivait sur son carnet pour une peau comme pour une contredanse.
Tranquille et doux comme Socrate au moment de boire la cigue, l'intrepide Tarasconnais avait un mot pour chacun, un sourire pour tout le monde.
Il parlait simplement, d'un air affable; on aurait dit qu'avant de partir, il voulait laisser derriere lui comme une trainee de charme, de regrets, de bons souvenirs.
D'entendre leur chef parler ainsi, tous les chasseurs de casquettes avaient des larmes, quelques-uns meme des remords, comme le president Ladeveze et le pharmacien Bezuquet.
Des hommes d'equipe pleuraient dans des coins.
Dehors, le peuple regardait a travers les grilles, et criait: "Vive Tartarin!" Enfin la cloche sonna.
Un roulement sourd, un sifflet dechirant ebranla, les voutes....
En voiture! en voiture! "Adieu, Tartarin!...
adieu, Tartarin!...
--Adieu, tous!..." murmura le grand homme, et sur les joues du brave commandant Bravida il embrassa son cher Tarascon.
Puis il s'elanca sur la voie, et monta dans un wagon plein de Parisiennes, qui penserent mourir de peur en voyant arriver cet homme etrange avec tant de carabines et de revolvers.
Le port de Marseille.
Embarque! Embarque! Page trente-deux Le premier decembre cent quatre-vingt-six..., a l'heure de midi, par un soleil d'hiver provencal, un temps clair, luisant, splendide, les Marseillais effares virent deboucher sur la Canebiere un Teur, oh mais, un Teur!...
Le pauvre homme croyait rever.
Il lui semblait qu'il s'appelait Sinbad le Marin, et qu'il errait dans une de ces villes fantastiques comme il y en a dans les Mille et une nuits.
C'etait a perte de vue un fouillis de mats, de vergues, se croisant dans tous les sens.
Pavillons de tous les pays, russes, grecs, suedois, tunisiens, americains....
Les navires au ras du quai, les beaupres arrivant sur la berge comme des rangees de baionnettes.
Au-dessous les naiades, les deesses, les saintes vierges et autres sculptures de bois peint qui donnent le nom au vaisseau; tout cela mange par l'eau de mer, devore, ruisselant, moisi....
De temps en temps, entre les navires, un morceau de mer, comme une grande moire tachee d'huile....
Dans l'enchevetrement des vergues, des nuees de mouettes faisant de jolies taches sur le ciel bleu, des mousses qui s'appelaient dans toutes les langues.
Page trente-trois Sur le quai, au milieu des ruisseaux qui venaient des savonneries, verts, epais, noiratres, charges d'huile et de soude, tout un peuple de douaniers, de commissionnaires, de portefaix avec leurs bogheys atteles de petits chevaux corses.
Des vendeuses de moules et de clovisses accroupies et piaillant a cote de leurs coquillages.
Des matelots passant avec des pots de goudron, des marmites fumantes, de grands paniers pleins de poulpes qu'ils allaient laver dans l'eau blanchatre des fontaines.
Partout, un encombrement prodigieux de marchandises de toute espece: soieries, minerais, trains de bois, saumons de plomb, draps, sucres, caroubes, colzas, reglisses, cannes a sucre.
L'Orient et l'Occident pele-mele.
De grands tas de fromages de Hollande que les Genoises teignaient en rouge avec leurs mains.
La-has, le quai au ble; les portefaix dechargeant leurs sacs sur la berge du haut de grands echafaudages.
Le ble, torrent d'or, qui roulait au milieu d'une fumee blonde.
Des hommes en fez rouge, le criblant a mesure dans de grands tamis de peau d'ane, et le chargeant sur des charrettes qui s'eloignaient suivies d'un regiment de femmes et d'enfants avec des balayettes et des paniers a glanes....
Page trente-quatre Parfois, entre les mats, une eclaircie.
Des navires qui s'en allaient en courant, toutes voiles dehors.
D'autres la-has, bien loin, qui arrivaient lentement, dans le soleil, comme en l'air.
C'est au son de cette belle fanfare que l'intrepide Tartarin de Tarascon s'embarqua pour le pays des lions!...
La traversee.
Les cinq positions de la chechia.
Le soir du troisieme jour.
Je vous la montrerais d'abord au depart sur le pont, heroique et superbe comme elle etait, aureolant cette belle tete tarasconnaise.
Je vous la montrerais ensuite a la sortie du port, quand le Zouave commence a caracoler sur les lames: je vous la montrerais fremissante, etonnee, et comme sentant deja les premieres atteintes de son mal.
Quatrieme position.
Six heures du soir, en vue des cotes corses.
L'infortunee chechia se penche par-dessus le bastingage et lamentablement regarde et sonde la mer....
Enfin, cinquieme et derniere position, au fond d'une etroite cabine, dans un petit lit qui a l'air d'un tiroir de commode, quelque chose d'informe et de desole roule en geignant sur l'oreiller.
C'est la Page trente-six chechia, l'heroique chechia du depart, reduite maintenant au vulgaire etat de casque a meche et s'enfoncant jusqu'aux oreilles d'une tete de malade bleme et convulsionnee....
Ma parole d'historien! le pauvre Teur faisait pitie.
Surpris tout a coup par le mal, l'infortune n'avait pas eu le courage de desserrer sa ceinture algerienne, ni de se defubler de son arsenal.
Le couteau de chasse a gros manche lui cassait la poitrine, le cuir de son revolver lui meurtrissait les jambes.
Pour l'achever, les bougonnements de Tartarin-Sancho, qui ne cessait de geindre et de pester: "Imbecile, va!...
Je te l'avais bien dit!...
Ah! tu as voulu aller en Afrique ...
Eh bien, te! la voila l'Afrique!...
Comment la trouves-tu?" Ce qu'il y avait de plus cruel, c'est que du fond de sa cabine et de ses gemissements, le malheureux entendait les passagers du grand salon rire, manger, chanter, jouer aux cartes.
La societe etait aussi joyeuse que nombreuse a bord du Zouave.
Des officiers qui rejoignaient leurs corps, des dames de l'Alcazar de Marseille, des cabotins, un riche musulman qui revenait de la Mecque, un prince montenegrin tres farceur qui faisait des imitations de Ravel et de Gil Peres....
Pas un de ces gens-la n'avait le mal de mer, et leur temps se passait a boire du Champagne avec le capitaine du Zouave, un bon gros vivant de Marseillais, qui avait menage a Alger et a Marseille, et repondait au joyeux nom de Barbassou.
Page trente-sept Tartarin de Tarascon en voulait a tous ces miserables.
Leur gaiete redoublait son mal....
Enfin, dans l'apres-midi du troisieme jour, il se fit a bord du navire un mouvement extraordinaire qui tira notre heros de sa longue torpeur.
La cloche de l'avant sonnait.
On entendait les grosses bottes des matelots courir sur le pont.
"Machine en avant!...
machine en arriere!" criait la voix enrouee du capitaine Barbassou.
Puis "Machine, stop!" Un grand arret, une secousse, et plus rien....
Rien que le paquebot se balancant silencieusement de droite a gauche, comme un ballon dans l'air....
Cet etrange silence epouvanta le Tarasconnais.
"Misericorde! nous sombrons!" cria-t-il d'une voix terrible, et, retrouvant ses forces par magie, il bondit de sa couchette, et se precipita sur le pont avec son arsenal.
Aux armes! Aux armes! On ne sombrait pas, on arrivait.
Le Zouave venait d'entrer dans la rade, une belle rade aux eaux noires et profondes, mais silencieuse, morne, presque deserte.
En face, sur une colline, Alger la blanche avec ses petites maisons d'un blanc mat qui descendent vers la mer, serrees les unes contre les autres.
Un etalage de blanchisseuse sur le coteau de Meudon.
Par la-dessus un grand ciel de satin bleu, oh! mais si bleu!...
L'illustre Tartarin, un peu remis de sa frayeur, regardait le paysage, en ecoutant avec respect le prince montenegrin, qui, debout a ses cotes, lui nommait les differents quartiers de la ville, la Casbah, la ville haute, la rue Bab-Azoun.
Tres bien eleve, ce prince montenegrin, de plus connaissant a fond l'Algerie et parlant l'arabe couramment.
Aussi Tartarin se proposait-il de Page trente-huit cultiver sa connaissance....
Tout a coup, le long du bastingage contre lequel ils etaient appuyes, le Tarasconnais apercoit une rangee de grosses mains noires qui se cramponnaient par dehors.
Presque aussitot une tete de negre toute crepue apparait devant lui, et, avant qu'il ait eu le temps d'ouvrir la bouche, le pont se trouve envahi de tous cotes par une centaine de forbans, noirs, jaunes, a moitie nus, hideux, terribles.
Ces forbans-la, Tartarin les connaissait....
C'etaient eux, c'est-a-dire ILS, ces fameux ILS qu'il avait si souvent cherches la nuit dans les rues de Tarascon.
Enfin ILS se decidaient donc a venir! ...
D'abord la surprise le cloua sur place.
"Ques aco? qu'est-ce qu'il y a? qu'est-ce que vous avez?" fit le capitaine Barbassou, qui sortait de l'entrepont.
"Ah! vous voila, capitaine!...
vite, vite, armez vos hommes.
--He! pourquoi faire, boun Diou? --Mais vous ne voyez donc pas...? --Quoi donc?...
--La ...
devant vous ...
les pirates...." Le capitaine Barbassou le regardait tout ahuri.
A ce moment, un grand diable de negre passait devant eux, en courant, avec la pharmacie du heros sur son dos: "Miserable!...
attends-moi!..." hurla le Tarasconnais; et il s'elanca, la dague en avant.
Barbassou le rattrapa au vol, et, le retenant par sa ceinture: "Mais restez donc tranquille, tron de ler!...
Ce ne sont pas des pirates....
Il y a longtemps qu'il n'y en a plus de Pirates....
Ce sont des portefaix.
Page trente-neuf --Des portefaix!...
--He! oui, des portefaix, qui viennent chercher les bagages pour les porter a terre....
Tous ses bagages y etaient deja, ses malles, caisses d'armes, conserves alimentaires; comme ils tenaient toute la barque, on n'eut pas besoin d'attendre d'autres voyageurs.
Le negre grimpa sur les malles et s'y accroupit comme un singe, les genoux dans ses mains.
Un autre negre prit les rames....
Tous deux regardaient Tartarin en riant et montrant leurs dents blanches.
Ou sont les Teurs? Pas de Teurs.
L'air etait chaud ce jour-la.
Mais a peine Tartarin eut-il mis pied a terre, le quai s'anima, changea d'aspect.
Une bande de sauvages, encore plus hideux que les forbans du bateau, se dressa d'entre les cailloux de la berge et se rua sur le debarquant.
Peine perdue.
On ne l'ecoutait pas....
Heureusement qu'un petit homme, vetu d'une tunique a collet jaune, et arme d'une longue canne de compagnon, intervint comme un dieu d'Homere dans la melee, et dispersa toute cette racaille a coups de baton.
C'etait un sergent de ville algerien.
Tres poliment, il engagea Tartarin a descendre a l'hotel de l'Europe, et le confia a des garcons de l'endroit qui l'emmenerent, lui et ses bagages, en plusieurs brouettes.
Aux premiers pas qu'il fit dans Alger, Tartarin de Tarascon ouvrit de grands yeux.
D'avance il s'etait figure une ville orientale, feerique, mythologique, quelque chose tenant le milieu entre Constantinople et Zanzibar....
Il tombait en plein Tarascon....
et pas un Teur!...
Il n'y avait que lui....
Aussi, pour traverser la place, se trouva-t-il un peu gene.
Tout le monde le regardait.
Les musiciens de la ligne s'arreterent, et la polka d'Offenbach resta un pied en l'air.
Les deux fusils sur l'epaule, le revolver sur la hanche, farouche et majestueux comme Robinson Crusoe, Tartarin passa gravement au milieu de tous les groupes; mais en arrivant a l'hotel ses forces l'abandonnerent.
Le depart de Tarascon, le port de Marseille, la traversee, le prince montenegrin, les pirates, tout se brouillait et roulait dans sa tete....
Il fallut le monter a sa chambre, le desarmer, le deshabiller....
Deja meme on parlait d'envoyer chercher un medecin; mais, a peine sur l'oreiller, le heros se mit a ronfler si haut et de si bon coeur, que l'hotelier jugea les secours de la science inutiles, et tout le monde se retira discretement.
Le premier affut.
Page quarante-deux Trois heures sonnaient a l'horloge du Gouvernement, quand Tartarin se reveilla.
Il avait dormi toute la soiree, toute la nuit, toute la matinee, et meme un bon morceau de l'apres-midi; il faut dire aussi que depuis trois jours la chechia en avait vu de rudes!...
un froid mortel le saisit, et il se fourra intrepidement sous sa couverture.
"Au lion! au lion!" cria-t-il en rejetant sa couverture, et il s'habilla prestement.
Voici quel etait son plan: sortir de la ville sans rien dire a personne, se jeter en plein desert, attendre la nuit, s'embusquer, et, au premier lion qui passerait, pan! pan!...
Puis revenir le lendemain dejeuner a l'hotel de l'Europe, recevoir les felicitations des Algeriens et freter une charrette pour aller chercher l'animal.
Il s'arma donc a la hate, roula sur son dos la tente-abri dont le gros manche montait d'un bon pied au-dessus de sa tete, et raide comme un pieu, descendit dans la rue.
Il y avait sur cette route un encombrement fantastique.
"Qu'est-ce qu'ils me chantent donc avec leur Orient?" pensait le grand Tartarin; "il n'y a pas meme tant de Teurs qu'a Marseille." Tout a coup, il vit passer pres de lui, allongeant ses grandes jambes et rengorge comme un dindon, un superbe chameau.
Cela lui fit battre le coeur.
Des chameaux deja! Les lions ne devaient pas etre loin; et, en effet, au bout de cinq minutes, il vit arriver vers lui, le fusil sur l'epaule, toute une troupe de chasseurs de lions.
"Les laches!" se dit notre heros en passant a cote d'eux, "les laches! Aller au lion par bandes, et avec des chiens!..." Car il ne se serait jamais imagine qu'en Algerie on put chasser autre chose que des lions.
Pourtant ces chasseurs avaient de si bonnes figures de commercants retires, et puis cette facon de chasser le lion avec des chiens et des carnassieres etait si patriarcale, que le Tarasconnais, un peu intrigue, crut devoir aborder un de ces messieurs.
"Et autrement, camarade, bonne chasse? --Pas mauvaise," repondit l'autre en regardant d'un oeil effare l'armement considerable du guerrier de Tarascon.
Page quarante-quatre "Vous avez tue? --Mais oui ...
pas mal ...
voyez plutot." Et le chasseur algerien montrait sa carnassiere, toute gonflee de lapins et de becasses.
"Comment ca! votre carnassiere?...
vous les mettez dans votre carnassiere? --Ou voulez-vous donc que je les mette? --Mais alors, c'est ...
c'est des tout petits....
--Des petits et puis des gros," fit le chasseur.
Et comme il etait presse de rentrer chez lui, il rejoignit ses camarades a grandes enjambees.
L'intrepide Tartarin en resta plante de stupeur au milieu de la route....
Puis, apres un moment de reflexion: "Bah!" se dit-il, "ce sont des blagueurs....
Ils n'ont rien tue du Tout...." et il continua son chemin.
Deja les maisons se faisaient plus rares, les passants aussi.
La nuit tombait, les objets devenaient confus...
Tartarin de Tarascon marcha encore une demi-heure.
A la fin il s'arreta....
C'etait tout a fait la nuit.
Nuit sans lune, criblee d'etoiles.
Personne sur la route....
Malgre tout, le heros pensa que les lions n'etaient pas des diligences et ne devaient pas volontiers suivre le grand chemin.
Il se jeta a travers champs....
A chaque pas des fosses, des ronces, des broussailles.
N'importe! il marchait toujours....
Puis tout a coup, halte! "Il y a du lion dans l'air par ici," se dit notre homme, et il renifla fortement de droite et de gauche.
Pan! Pan! C'etait un grand desert sauvage, tout herisse de plantes bizarres, de ces plantes d'Orient qui ont l'air de betes mechantes.
Sous le jour discret des etoiles, leur ombre agrandie s'etirait par terre en tous sens.
A droite, la masse confuse et lourde d'une Page quarante-cinq montagne, l'Atlas peut-etre!...
A gauche, la mer invisible, qui roulait sourdement....
Un vrai gite a tenter les fauves....
Un fusil devant lui, un autre dans les mains, Tartarin de Tarascon mit un genou en terre et attendit....
Il attendit une heure, deux heures....
Rien!...
Alors il se souvint que, dans ses livres, les grands tueurs de lions n'allaient jamais a la chasse sans emmener un petit chevreau qu'ils attachaient a quelques pas devant eux et qu'ils faisaient crier en lui tirant la patte avec une ficelle.
N'ayant pas de chevreau, le Tarasconnais eut l'idee d'essayer des imitations, et se mit a beler d'une voix chevrotante: "Me! Me!..." D'abord tres doucement, parce qu'au fond de l'ame il avait tout de meme un peu peur que le lion l'entendit ...
puis, voyant que rien ne venait, il bela plus fort: "Me!...
Me!..." Rien encore!...
Impatiente, il reprit de plus belle et plusieurs fois de suite: "Me!...
Me!...
Me!..." avec tant de puissance que ce chevreau finissait par avoir l'air d'un boeuf....
Tout a coup, a quelques pas devant lui, quelque chose de noir et de gigantesque s'abattit.
Il se tut....
Cela se baissait, flairait la terre, bondissait, se roulait, partait au galop, puis revenait et s'arretait net ...
c'etait le lion, a n'en pas douter!...
Maintenant on voyait tres bien ses quatre pattes courtes, sa formidable encolure, et deux yeux, deux grands yeux qui luisaient dans l'ombre....
En joue! feu! pan! pan!...
C'etait fait.
Puis tout de suite un bondissement en arriere, et le coutelas de chasse au poing.
Au coup de feu du Tarasconnais, un hurlement terrible repondit.
"Il en a!" cria le bon Tartarin, et, ramasse sur ses fortes jambes, il se preparait a recevoir la bete; mais elle en avait plus que son compte et s'enfuit au triple galop en hurlant....
Lui pourtant ne bougea pas.
Il attendait la femelle ...
toujours comme dans ses livres! Page quarante-six Par malheur la femelle ne vint pas.
Au bout de deux ou trois heures d'attente, le Tarasconnais se lassa.
La terre etait humide, la nuit devenait fraiche, la bise de mer piquait.
"Si je faisais un somme en attendant le jour?" se dit-il, et, pour eviter les rhumatismes, il eut recours a la tente-abri....
Mais voila le diable! cette tente-abri etait d'un systeme si ingenieux, si ingenieux, qu'il ne put jamais venir a bout de l'ouvrir.
Il eut beau s'escrimer et suer pendant une heure, la damnee tente ne s'ouvrit pas....
Il y a des parapluies qui, par des pluies torrentielles, s'amusent a vous jouer de ces tours-la....
De guerre lasse, le Tarasconnais jeta l'ustensile par terre, et se coucha dessus, en jurant comme un vrai Provencal qu'il etait.
"Ta, ta, ra, ta, Tarata!....
--Ques aco?..." fit Tartarin, s'eveillant en sursaut.
C'etaient les clairons des chasseurs d'Afrique qui sonnaient la diane, dans les casernes de Mustapha....
Le tueur de lions, stupefait, se frotta les yeux....
Lui qui se croyait en plein desert!...
Savez-vous ou il etait...? Dans un carre d'artichauts, entre un plant de choux-fleurs et un plant de betteraves.
Son Sahara avait des legumes....
Tout pres de lui, sur la jolie cote verte de Mustapha superieur, des villas algeriennes, toutes blanches, luisaient dans la rosee du jour levant: on se serait cru aux environs de Marseille, au milieu des bastides et des bastidons.
La physionomie bourgeoise et potagere de ce paysage endormi etonna beaucoup le pauvre homme, et le mit de fort mechante humeur.
"Ces gens-la sont fous," se disait-il, "de planter leurs artichauts dans le voisinage du lion....
car enfin, je n'ai pas reve....
Les lions viennent jusqu'ici....
En voila la preuve...." La preuve, c'etaient des taches de sang que la bete en fuyant avait laissees derriere elle.
Penche sur cette piste sanglante, l'oeil Page quarante-sept aux aguets, le revolver au poing, le vaillant Tarasconnais arriva, d'artichaut en artichaut, jusqu'a un petit champ d'avoine....
De l'herbe foulee, une mare de sang, et, au milieu de la mare, couche sur le flanc avec une large plaie a la tete, un....
Devinez quoi!...
"Un lion, parbleu!..." Non! un ane, un de ces tout petits anes qui sont si communs en Algerie et qu'on designe la-bas sous le nom de bourriquots.
Arrivee de la femelle.
Terrible combat.
Le Rendez-vous des Lapins.
Le premier mouvement de Tartarin a l'aspect de sa malheureuse victime fut un mouvement de depit.
Il y a si loin en effet d'un lion a un bourriquot!....
Son second mouvement fut tout a la pitie.
Le pauvre bourriquot etait si joli; il avait l'air si bon! La peau de ses flancs, encore chaude, allait et venait comme une vague.
Tartarin s'agenouilla, et du bout de sa ceinture algerienne essaya d'etancher le sang de la malheureuse bete; et ce grand homme soignant ce petit ane, c'etait tout ce que vous pouvez imaginer de plus touchant.
Au contact soyeux de la ceinture, le bourriquot, qui avait encore pour deux liards de vie, ouvrit son grand oeil gris, remua deux ou trois fois ses longues oreilles comme pour dire: "Merci!...
merci!..." Puis une derniere convulsion l'agita de tete en queue et il ne bougea plus.
"Noiraud! Noiraud!" cria tout a coup une voix etranglee par l'angoisse.
En meme temps dans un taillis voisin les branches remuerent....
Tartarin n'eut que le temps de se relever et de se mettre en garde....
C'etait la femelle! Elle arriva, terrible et rugissante, sous les traits d'une vieille Alsacienne en marmotte, armee d'un grand parapluie rouge et Page quarante-huit reclamant son ane a tous les echos de Mustapha.
Certes il aurait mieux valu pour Tartarin avoir affaire a une lionne en furie qu'a cette mechante vieille....
Vainement le malheureux essaya de lui faire entendre comment la chose s'etait passee; qu'il avait pris Noiraud pour un lion....
La vieille crut qu'on voulait se moquer d'elle, et poussant d'energiques "tarteifle!" tomba sur le heros a coups de parapluie.
Tartarin, un peu confus, se defendait de son mieux, parait les coups avec sa carabine, suait, soufflait, bondissait, criait:--"Mais Madame ...
mais Madame...." Va te promener! Madame etait sourde, et sa vigueur le prouvait bien.
Heureusement un troisieme personnage arriva sur le champ de bataille.
C'etait le mari de l'Alsacienne, Alsacien lui-meme et cabaretier; de plus, fort bon comptable.
Quand il vit a qui il avait affaire, et que l'assassin ne demandait qu'a payer le prix de la victime, il desarma son epouse et l'on s'entendit.
Tartarin donna deux cents francs: l'ane en valait bien dix.
C'est le prix courant des bourriquots sur les marches arabes.
Les chasseurs algeriens venaient y dejeuner tous les dimanches car la plaine etait giboyeuse et a deux lieues autour de la ville il n'y avait pas de meilleur endroit pour les lapins.
"Et les lions?" demanda Tartarin.
L'Alsacien le regarda, tres etonne: "Les lions? --Oui ...
les lions ...
en voyez-vous quelquefois?" reprit le pauvre homme avec un peu moins d'assurance.
Le cabaretier eclata de rire: Page quarante-neuf "Ah! ben! merci....
Des lions ...
pourquoi faire?...
--Il n'y en a donc pas en Algerie?...
--Ma foi! je n'en ai jamais vu....
Et pourtant voila vingt ans que j'habite la province.
Cependant je crois bien avoir entendu dire....
Il me semble que les journaux....
Mais c'est beaucoup plus loin, la-bas, dans le Sud...." A ce moment, ils arrivaient au cabaret.
Un cabaret de banlieue, comme on en voit a Vanves ou a Pantin, avec un rameau tout fane au-dessus de la porte, des queues de billard peintes sur les murs et cette enseigne inoffensive: Le Rendez-vous des Lapins!...
O Bravida, quel souvenir! Histoire d'un omnibus, d'une Mauresque et d'un chapelet de fleurs de jasmin.
Cette premiere aventure aurait eu de quoi decourager bien des gens; mais les hommes trempes comme Tartarin ne se laissent pas facilement abattre.
Malheureusement la grande route de Mustapha semblait s'etre allongee depuis la veille: il faisait un soleil, une poussiere! La tente-abri etait d'un lourd!...
Tartarin ne se sentit pas le Page cinquante courage d'aller a pied jusqu'a la ville, et le premier omnibus qui passa, il fit signe et monta dedans....
Tartarin etant monte, L'omnibus fut complet.
Il y avait au fond, le nez dans son breviaire, un vicaire d'Alger a grande barbe noire.
En face, un jeune marchand maure, qui fumait de grosses cigarettes.
Puis, un matelot maltais, et quatre ou cinq Mauresques masquees de linges blancs, et dont on ne pouvait voir que les yeux.
Ces dames venaient de faire leurs devotions an cimetiere d'Abd-el-Kader; mais cette visite funebre ne semblait pas les avoir attristees.
On les entendait rire et jacasser entre elles sous leurs masques, en croquant des patisseries.
Tartarin crut s'apercevoir qu'elles le regardaient beaucoup.
Une surtout, celle qui etait assise en face de lui, avait plante son regard dans le sien, et ne le retira pas de toute la route.
Le malheureux Tartarin ne savait ou se fourrer.
La caresse muette de ces beaux yeux d'Orient le troublait, l'agitait, le faisait mourir; il avait chaud, il avait froid....
Pour l'achever, la pantoufle de la dame s'en mela: sur ses grosses bottes de chasse, il la sentait courir, cette mignonne pantoufle courir et fretiller comme une petite souris rouge....
Que faire? Repondre a ce regard, a cette pression! Oui, mais les consequences....
Une intrigue d'amour en Orient, c'est Page cinquante et un quelque chose de terrible!...
Et avec son imagination romanesque et meridionale, le brave Tarasconnais se voyait deja tombant aux mains des eunuques, decapite, mieux que cela peut-etre, cousu dans un sac de cuir, et roulant sur la mer, sa tete a cote de lui.
Cela le refroidissait un peu....
En attendant, la petite pantoufle continuait son manege, et les yeux d'en face s'ouvraient tout grands vers lui comme deux fleurs de velours noir, en ayant l'air de dire: --Cueille-nous!...
L'omnibus s'arreta.
On etait sur la place du Theatre, a l'entree de la rue Bab-Azoun.
Une a une, empetrees dans leurs grands pantalons et serrant leurs voiles contre elles avec une grace sauvage, les Mauresques descendirent.
La voisine de Tartarin se leva la derniere, et en se levant son visage passa si pres de celui du heros qu'il l'effleura de son haleine, un vrai bouquet de jeunesse, de jasmin, de musc et de patisserie.
Le Tarasconnais n'y resista pas.
Ivre d'amour et pret a tout, il s'elanca derriere la Mauresque....
Au bruit de ses buffleteries elle se retourna, mit un doigt sur son masque comme pour dire "chut!" et vivement, de l'autre main, elle lui jeta un petit chapelet parfume, fait avec des fleurs de jasmin.
Tartarin de Tarascon se baissa pour le ramasser; mais, comme notre heros etait un peu lourd et tres charge d'armures, un'operation fut assez longue....
Quand il se releva, le chapelet de jasmin sur son coeur,--la Mauresque avait disparu.
Lions de l'Atlas, dormez! Lions de un'Atlas, dormez! Dormez tranquilles au fond de vos retraites, dans les aloes et les cactus sauvages....
De quelques jours encore, Tartarin de Tarascon ne vous massacrera point.
Pour le moment, tout son attirail de guerre, Page cinquante-deux --caisses d'armes, pharmacie, tente-abri, conserves alimentaires, --repose paisiblement emballe, a l'hotel d'Europe, dans un coin de la chambre trente-six.
Dormez sans peur, grands lions roux! Le Tarasconnais cherche sa Mauresque.
Le terrible c'est que, sous leurs grands masques blancs, toutes les Mauresques se ressemblent; puis ces dames ne sortent guere, et, quand on veut en voir, il faut monter dans la ville haute, la ville arabe, la ville des Teurs.
Un vrai coupe-gorge, cette ville haute.
De petites ruelles noires tres etroites, grimpant a pic entre deux rangees de maisons mysterieuses dont les toitures se rejoignent et font tunnel.
Des portes basses, des fenetres toutes petites, muettes, tristes, grillagees.
Et puis, de droite et de gauche, un tas d'echoppes tres sombres ou les Teurs farouches a tetes de forbans --yeux blancs et dents brillantes--fument de longues pipes, et se parlent a voix basse comme pour concerter de mauvais coups....
Dire que notre Tartarin traversait sans emotion cette cite formidable, ce serait mentir.
Il etait au contraire tres emu, et dans ces ruelles obscures dont son gros ventre tenait toute la largeur, le brave homme n'avancait qu'avec la plus grande precaution, l'oeil aux aguets, le doigt sur la detente d'un revolver.
Page cinquante-trois Tout a fait comme a Tarascon, en allant au cercle.
A chaque instant il s'attendait a recevoir sur le dos toute une degringolade d'eunuques et de janissaires, mais le desir de revoir sa dame lui donnait une audace et une force de geant.
Huit jours durant, l'intrepide Tartarin ne quitta pas la ville haute.
"Elle est peut-etre la!" se disait-il.
Alors, si la rue etait deserte, il s'approchait d'une de ces maisons, levait le lourd marteau de la poterne basse, et frappait timidement....
Aussitot les chants, les rires cessaient.
On n'entendait plus derriere la muraille que de petits chuchotements vagues, comme dans une voliere endormie.
"Tenons-nous bien!" pensait le heros....
"Il va m'arriver quelque chose!" Ce qui lui arrivait le plus souvent, c'etait une grande potee d'eau froide sur la tete, ou bien des peaux d'oranges et de figues de Barbarie....
Jamais rien de plus grave....
Lions de l'Atlas, dormez! Le prince Gregory du Montenegro.
Page cinquante-quatre Il y avait deux grandes semaines que l'infortune Tartarin cherchait sa dame algerienne, et tres vraisemblablement il la chercherait encore, si la Providence des amants n'etait venue a son aide sous les traits d'un gentilhomme montenegrin.
Voici: En hiver, toutes les nuits de samedi, le grand theatre d'Alger donne son bal masque, ni plus ni moins que l'Opera.
C'est l'eternel et insipide bal masque de province.
Le vrai coup d'oeil n'est pas la.
Il est au foyer, transforme pour la circonstance en salon de jeu....
tous fremissants, pales, les dents serrees, avec ce regard singulier du joueur, trouble, en biseau, devenu louche a force de fixer toujours la meme carte.
Plus loin, ce sont des tribus de juifs algeriens, jouant en famille.
Les hommes out le costume oriental hideusement agremente de bas bleus et de casquettes de velours.
Les femmes, bouffies et blafardes, se tiennent toutes raides dans leurs etroits plastrons d'or....
Groupee autour des tables, toute la tribu piaille, se concerte, compte sur ses doigts et joue peu.
De temps en temps seulement, apres de longs conciliabules, un vieux patriarche a barbe de Pere eternel se detache, et va risquer le douro familial....
C'est alors, tant que la partie dure< Page cinquante-cinq un scintillement d'yeux hebraiques tournes vers la table, terribles yeux d'aimant noir qui font fretiller les pieces d'or sur le tapis et finissent par les attirer tout doucement comme par un fil....
Puis des querelles, des batailles, des jurons de tous les pays, des cris fous dans toutes les langues, des couteaux qu'on degaine, la garde qui monte, de l'argent qui manque!...
C'est au milieu de ces saturnales que le grand Tartarin etait venu s'egarer un soir, pour chercher l'oubli et la paix de coeur.
Le heros s'en allait seul, dans la foule, pensant a sa Mauresque, quand tout a coup, a une table de jeu, par-dessus les cris, le bruit de l'or, deux voix irritees s'eleverent: "Je vous dis qu'il me manque vingt francs, M'sieu!...
--M'sieu!...
--Apres?...
M'sieu!...
Malheureusement, ce titre d'altesse, qui avait tant ebloui le bon Tarasconnais, ne produisit pas la moindre impression sur l'officier de chasseurs avec qui le prince avait son algarade.
"Me voila bien avance...." fit le militaire en ricanant; puis se tournant vers la galerie: "Gregory du Montenegro ...
qui connait ca?...
Personne!" Tartarin indigne fit un pas en avant.
"Pardon ...
je connais le preince!" dit-il d'une voix tres ferme, et de son plus bel accent tarasconnais.
L'officier de chasseurs le regarda un moment bien en face, puis, levant les epaules: Page cinquante-six "Allons! c'est bon....
Partagez-vous les vingt francs qui manquent et qu'il n'en soit plus question." La-dessus il tourna le dos et se perdit dans la foule.
Le fougueux Tartarin voulait s'elancer derriere lui, mais le prince l'en empecha: "Laissez ...
j'en fais mon affaire." Et, prenant le Tarasconnais par le bras, il l'entraina dehors rapidement.
Des qu'ils furent sur la place, le prince Gregory du Montenegro se decouvrit, tendit la main a notre heros, et, se rappelant vaguement son nom, commenca d'une voix vibrante: "Monsieur Barbarin....
--Tartarin!" souffla l'autre timidement.
--Tartarin, Barbarin, n'importe!...
Entre nous, maintenant, c'est a la vie, a la mort!" Et le noble Montenegrin lui secoua la main avec une farouche energie....
Vous pensez si le Tarasconnais etait fier.
"Preince!...
Preince!..." repetait-il avec ivresse.
Un quart d'heure apres, ces deux messieurs etaient installes au restaurant des Platanes, agreable maison de nuit dont les terrasses plongent sur la mer, et la, devant une forte salade russe arrosee d'un joli vin de Crescia, on renoua connaissance.
Vous ne pouvez rien imaginer de plus seduisant que ce prince montenegrin.
De vieille race hereditaire, ses freres l'avaient, parait-il, exile des l'age de dix ans, a cause de ses opinions liberales, et depuis il courait le monde pour son instruction et son plaisir, en Altesse Page cinquante-sept philosophe....
Coincidence singuliere! Le prince avait passe trois ans a Tarascon, et comme Tartarin s'etonnait de ne l'avoir jamais rencontre au cercle ou sur un'Esplanade: "Je sortais Peu...." fit l'Altesse d'un ton evasif.
Et le Tarasconnais, par discretion, n'osa pas en demander davantage.
Toutes ces grandes existences out des cotes si mysterieux!...
En fin de compte, un tres bon prince, ce seigneur Gregory.
Tout en sirotant le vin rose de Crescia, il ecouta patiemment Tartarin lui parler de sa Mauresque et meme il se fit fort, connaissant toutes ces dames, de la retrouver promptement.
On but sec et longtemps.
On trinqua "aux dames d'Alger! au Montenegro libre!..." Dehors sous la terrasse, la mer roulait, et les vagues, dans l'ombre, battaient la rive avec un bruit de draps mouilles qu'on secoue.
L'air etait chaud, le ciel plein d'etoiles.
Dans les platanes, un rossignol chantait....
Ce fut Tartarin qui paya la note.
Dis-moi le nom de ton pere, et je te dirai le nom de cette fleur.
Parlez-moi des princes montenegrins pour lever lestement la caille.
Le lendemain de cette soiree aux Platanes, des le petit jour, le prince Gregory etait dans la chambre du Tarasconnais.
"Vite, vite, habillez-vous....
Votre Mauresque est retrouvee....
Elle s'appelle Baia....
Vingt ans, jolie comme un coeur, et deja veuve....
--Veuve!...
quelle chance!" fit joyeusement le brave Tartarin, qui se mefiait des maris d'Orient.
"Oui, mais tres surveillee par son frere.
--Ah! diantre!...
Page cinquante-huit --Un Maure farouche qui vend des pipes au bazar d'Orleans...." Ici un silence.
"Bon!" reprit le prince, "vous n'etes pas homme a vous effrayer pour si peu; et puis on viendra peut-etre a bout de ce forban en lui achetant quelques pipes....
Allons vite, habillez-vous ...
"Elle n'en sait pas un mot," repondit le prince imperturbablement....
"mais vous allez me dicter la lettre, et je traduirai a mesure.
--O prince, que de bontes!" Et le Tarasconnais se mit a marcher a grands pas dans la chambre, silencieux et se recueillant.
Vous pensez qu'on n'ecrit pas a une Mauresque d'Alger comme a une grisette de Beaucaire.
"Allons vite acheter des pipes!" fit Tartarin plein d'ardeur.
"Non!...
non!...
Laissez-moi y aller seul.
Je les aurai a meilleur compte....
--Comment! vous voulez ...
O prince ...
prince...." Et le brave homme, tout confus, tendit sa bourse a l'obligeant Montenegrin, en lui recommandant de ne rien negliger pour que la dame fut contente.
Malheureusement l'affaire--quoique bien lancee--ne marcha pas aussi vite qu'on aurait pu l'esperer.
"Qu'est-ce que diable Baia peut faire de toutes ces pipes?" se demandait parfois le pauvre Tartarin;--mais il payait quand meme et sans lesiner.
Enfin, apres avoir achete des montagnes de pipes et repandu des flots de poesie orientale, on obtint un rendez-vous.
Le prince, toujours obligeant, vint a ce premier rendez-vous en qualite d'interprete.
La dame habitait dans le haut de la ville.
Devant sa porte, un jeune Maure de treize a quatorze Page soixante ans fumait des cigarettes.
C'etait le fameux Ali, le frere en question.
En voyant arriver les deux visiteurs, il frappa deux coups a la poterne et se retira discretement.
La porte s'ouvrit.
Une negresse parut qui, sans dire un seul mot, conduisit ces messieurs a travers l'etroite cour interieure dans une petite chambre fraiche ou la dame attendait, accoudee sur un lit bas....
Au premier abord, elle parut au Tarasconnais plus petite et plus forte que la Mauresque de l'omnibus.
Au fait, etait-ce bien la meme? Mais ce soupcon ne fit que traverser le cerveau de Tartarin comme un eclair.
En entrant, le Tarasconnais posa une main sur son coeur, et s'inclina le plus mauresquement possible, en roulant de gros yeux passionnes....
Baia le regarda un moment sans dire; puis, lachant son tuyau d'ambre, se renversa en arriere, cacha sa tete dans ses mains, et un'on ne vit plus que son cou blanc qu'un fou rire faisait danser comme un sac rempli de perles.
Sidi Tart'ri ben Tart'ri.
Page soixante et un Le Sidi Tart'ri en question qui a laisse de si gais souvenirs autour de la Casbah n'est autre, on le devine, que notre Tartarin....
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez? Il y a comme cela, dans la vie des saints et des heros, des heures d'aveuglement, de trouble, de defaillance.
L'illustre Tarasconnais n'en fut pas plus exempt qu'un autre, et c'est pourquoi--deux mois durant--oublieux des lions et de la gloire, il se grisa d'amour oriental et s'endormit, comme Annibal a Capoue, dans les delices d'Alger la Blanche.
Le brave homme avait loue au coeur de la ville arabe une jolie maisonnette indigene avec cour interieure, bananiers, galeries fraiches et fontaines.
Il vivait la loin de tout bruit en compagnie de sa Mauresque, Maure lui-meme de la tete aux pieds, soufflant tout le jour dans son narghile, et mangeant des confitures au musc.
Le narghile, le bain, l'amour remplissaient toute sa vie.
On sortait peu.
Quelquefois Sidi Tart'ri, sa dame en croupe, s'en allait sur une brave mule manger des grenades a un petit Page soixante-deux jardin qu'il avait achete aux environs....
Mais jamais, au grand jamais, il ne descendait dans la ville europeenne.
Avec ses zouaves en ribotte, ses alcazars bourres d'officiers, et son eternel bruit de sabres trainant sous les arcades, cet Alger-la lui semblait insupportable et laid comme un corps de garde d'Occident.
En somme, le Tarasconnais etait tres heureux.
Tartarin-Sancho surtout, tres friand de patisseries turques, se declarait on ne peut plus satisfait de sa nouvelle existence....
Tartarin-Quichotte, lui, avait bien par-ci par-la quelques remords, en pensant a Tarascon et aux peaux promises....
Mais cela ne durait pas, et pour chasser ces tristes idees il suffisait d'un regard de Baia ou d'une cuilleree de ses diaboliques confitures odorantes et troublantes comme les breuvages de Circe.
Le soir, le prince Gregory venait parler un peu du Montenegro libre....
D'une complaisance infatigable, cet aimable seigneur remplissait dans la maison les fonctions d'interprete, au besoin meme celles d'intendant, et tout cela pour rien, pour le plaisir....
A part lui, Tartarin ne recevait que des Teurs.
Quatre ou cinq fois par semaine, ces messieurs venaient passer la soiree chez Sidi Tart'ri, lui gagnaient son argent, lui mangeaient ses confitures, et sur le coup de dix heures se retiraient discretement en remerciant le Prophete.
Derriere eux, Sidi Tart'ri et sa fidele epouse finissaient la soiree sur leur terrasse, une grande terrasse blanche qui faisait toit a la maison et dominait la ville.
Tout autour, un millier d'autres terrasses blanches aussi, tranquilles sous le clair de lune, Page soixante-trois descendaient en s'echelonnant jusqu'a la mer.
Des fredons de guitare arrivaient, portes par la brise.
Aussitot Baia lachait sa guitare, et ses grands yeux tournes vers le muezzin semblaient boire la priere avec delices.
Tant que le chant durait, elle restait la, frissonnante, extasiee, comme une sainte Therese d'Orient....
Tartarin, tout emu, la regardait prier et pensait en lui-meme que c'etait une forte et belle religion, celle qui pouvait causer des ivresses de foi pareilles.
Tarascon, voile-toi la face! ton Tartarin songeait a se faire renegat.
On nous ecrit de Tarascon.
Par une belle apres-midi de ciel bleu et de brise tiede, Sidi Tart'ri a califourchon sur sa mule revenait tout seulet de son petit clos....
Tout a coup, en entrant dans la ville, un appel formidable le reveilla.
"He! adieu, Barbassou," fit Tartarin en arretant sa mule.
Au lieu de lui repondre, Barbassou le regarda un moment avec de grands yeux; puis, le voila parti a rire, a rire tellement, Que Sidi Tart'ri en resta tout interloque, le derriere sur ses pasteques.
"Que turban, mon pauvre monsieur Tartarin!...
C'est donc vrai ce qu'on dit, que vous vous etes fait Teur?...
Et la petite Baia, est-ce qu'elle chante toujours Marco la Belle? --Marco la Belle! " fit Tartarin indigne....
"Apprenez, capitaine, que la personne dont vous parlez est une honnete fille maure, et qu'elle ne sait pas un mot de francais.
--Baia, pas un mot de francais?...
D'ou sortez-vous donc?..." Et le brave capitaine se remit a rire plus fort.
Puis voyant la mine du pauvre Sidi Tart'ri qui s'allongeait, il se ravisa.
"Au fait, ce n'est peut-etre pas la meme....
Mettons que j'ai confondu.
Seulement, voyez-vous, monsieur Tartarin, vous ferez tout de meme bien de vous mefier des Mauresques algeriennes et des princes du Montenegro!..." Tartarin se dressa sur ses etriers, en faisant sa moue.
"Le prince est mon ami, capitaine.
--Bon! bon! ne nous fachons pas....
Vous ne prenez pas une absinthe? Non.
Rien a faire dire au pays?...
Non plus....
Eh bien! alors, bon voyage....
A propos, collegue, j'ai la du bon tabac de France, si vous en vouliez emporter quelques pipes....
Prenez donc! prenez donc! ca vous fera du bien....
Ce sont vos sacres tabacs d'Orient qui vous barbouillent les idees." Page soixante-cinq La-dessus le capitaine retourna a son absinthe et Tartarin, tout pensif, reprit au petit trot le chemin de sa maisonnette....
Bien que sa grande ame se refusat a rien en croire, les insinuations de Barbassou l'avaient attriste, puis ces jurons du cru, l'accent de la-bas, tout cela eveillait en lui de vagues remords.
Au logis, il ne trouva personne.
Baia etait au bain....
La negresse lui parut laide, la maison triste....
En proie a une indefinissable melancolie, il vint s'asseoir pres de la fontaine et bourra une pipe avec le tabac de Barbassou.
Ce tabac etait enveloppe dans un fragment du Semaphore.
En le deployant, le nom de sa ville natale lui sauta aux yeux.
On nous ecrit de Tarascon: "La ville est dans les transes.
Tartarin, le tueur de lions, parti pour chasser les grands felins en Afrique, n'a pas donne de ses nouvelles depuis plusieurs mois....
Qu'est devenu notre heroique compatriote?...
 On ose a peine se le demander, quand on a connu comme nous cette tete ardente, cette audace, ce besoin d'aventures....
A-t-il ete comme tant d'autres englouti dans le sable, ou bien est-il tombe sous la dent meurtriere d'un de ces monstres de l'Atlas dont il avait promis les peaux a la municipalite?...
Terrible incertitude! Pourtant des marchands negres, venus a la foire de Beaucaire, pretendent avoir rencontre en plein desert un Europeen dont le signalement se rapportait au sien, et qui se dirigeait vers Tombouctou....
Dieu nous garde notre Tartarin!" Quand il lut cela, le Tarasconnais rougit, palit, frissonna.
Tout Tarascon lui apparut: le cercle, les chasseurs de casquettes, le fauteuil vert chez Costecalde, et planant au-dessus comme un aigle eploye, la formidable moustache du brave commandant Bravida.
Alors, de se voir la, comme il etait, lachement accroupi sur sa natte, tandis qu'on le croyait en train de massacrer des fauves, Tartarin de Tarascon eut honte de lui-meme et pleura.
Tout a coup le heros bondit: "Au lion! au lion!" Page soixante-six Et s'elancant dans le reduit poudreux ou dormaient la tente-abri, la pharmacie, les conserves, la caisse d'armes, il les traina au milieu de la cour.
Tartarin-Sancho venait d'expirer; il ne restait plus que Tartarin-Quichotte.
Les diligences deportees.
Page soixante-sept C'etait une vieille diligence d'autrefois, capitonnee a l'ancienne mode de drap gros bleu tout fane, avec ces enormes pompons de laine reche qui, apres quelques heures de route, finissent par vous faire des moxas dans le dos....
Il y avait de tout un peu dans cette rotonde.
Un trappiste, des marchands juifs, deux cocottes qui rejoignaient leur corps --le troisième hussards,--un photographe d'Orleansville....
Mais, si charmante et variee que fut la compagnie, le Tarasconnais n'etait pas en train de causer et resta la tout pensif, le bras passe dans la brassiere, avec ses carabines entre ses genoux....
Peu a peu la nuit tomba.
Le conducteur alluma ses lanternes....
La diligence rouillee sautait en criant sur ses vieux Page soixante-huit ressorts; les chevaux trottaient, les grelots tintaient....
De temps en temps la-haut, sous la bache de l'imperiale, un terrible bruit de ferraille....
C'etait le materiel de guerre.
Subitement, une voix, une voix de vieille fee, enrouee, cassee, felee, appela le Tarasconnais par son nom: "Monsieur Tartarin! monsieur Tartarin! --Qui m'appelle? --C'est moi, monsieur Tartarin; vous ne me reconnaissez pas?...
Je suis la vieille diligence qui faisait--il y a vingt ans--le service de Tarascon a Nimes....
Que de fois je vous ai portes, vous et vos amis, quand vous alliez chasser les casquettes du cote de Joncquieres ou de Bellegarde!...
Je ne vous ai pas remis d'abord, a cause de votre bonnet de Teur et du corps que vous avez pris; mais sitot que vous vous etes mis a ronfler, coquin de bon sort! je vous ai reconnu tout de suite.
--C'est bon! c'est bon!" fit le Tarasconnais un peu vexe.
Puis, se radoucissant: --"Mais enfin, ma pauvre vieille, qu'est-ce que vous etes venue faire ici? --Ah! mon bon monsieur Tartarin, je n'y suis pas venue de mon plein gre, je vous assure....
Une fois que le chemin de fer de Beaucaire a ete fini, ils ne m'ont plus trouvee bonne a rien et ils m'ont envoyee en Afrique....
Et je ne suis pas la seule! presque toutes les diligences de France ont ete deportees comme moi.
On nous trouvait trop reactionnaires, et maintenant nous voila toutes ici a mener une vie de galere....
Quelle belle route, monsieur Tartarin, large, bien entretenue, avec ses bornes kilometriques, ses petits tas de pierres regulierement espaces, et de droite et de gauche ses jolies plaines d'oliviers et de vignes....
Puis des auberges tous les dix pas, des relais toutes les cinq minutes....
Maintenant c'est une autre histoire....
Et puis vous Page soixante-dix voyez comme on me traite! Jamais brossee, jamais lavee.
On me plaint le cambouis de mes essieux....
Au lieu de mes gros bons chevaux tranquilles d'autrefois, de petits chevaux arabes qui out le diable au corps, se battent, se mordent, dansent en courant comme des chevres, et me brisent mes brancards a coups de pieds....
 Aie!...
aie!...
tenez!...
Voila que cela Commence....
Et les routes! Par ici, c'est encore supportable, parce que nous sommes pres du gouvernement, mais la-bas, plus rien, pas de chemin du tout.
On va comme on peut, a travers monts et plaines, dans les palmiers nains, dans les lentisques....
Pas un seul relais fixe.
On arrete au caprice du conducteur, tantot dans une ferme, tantot dans une autre.
Quelquefois ce polisson-la me fait faire un detour de deux lieues pour aller chez un ami boire l'absinthe ou le champoreau....
Apres quoi, fouette, postillon! il faut rattraper le temps perdu.
Le soleil cuit, la poussiere brule.
Fouette toujours! On accroche, on verse! Fouette plus fort! On passe des rivieres a la nage, on s'enrhume, on se mouille, on se noie....
Fouette! fouette! fouette!...
Puis le soir, toute ruisselante,--c'est cela qui est bon a mon age, avec mes rhumatismes!...--il me faut coucher a la belle etoile, dans une cour de caravanserail ouverte a tous les vents.
La nuit, des chacals, des hyenes viennent flairer mes caissons, et les maraudeurs qui craignent la rosee se mettent au chaud dans mes compartiments....
--Blidah! Blidah!" fit le conducteur en ouvrant la portiere.
Les cafes otaient leurs volets.
Dans un coin, une halle avec des legumes....
C'etait charmant, mais cela ne sentait pas encore le lion.
"Au sud!...
Plus au sud!" murmura le bon Tartarin en se renfoncant dans son coin.
A ce moment, la portiere s'ouvrit.
En apercevant le materiel de guerre du Tarasconnais, le petit monsieur, qui s'etait assis en face, parut excessivement surpris et se mit a regarder Tartarin avec une insistance genante.
On detela, on attela, la diligence partit....
Le petit monsieur regardait toujours Tartarin....
A la fin le Tarasconnais prit la mouche.
"Ca vous etonne?" fit-il en regardant a son tour le petit monsieur bien en face.
"Non! Ca me gene," repondit l'autre fort tranquillement; et le fait est qu'avec sa tente-abri, son revolver, ses deux fusils dans dans leur gaine, son couteau de chasse,--sans parler de sa corpulence naturelle, Tartarin de Tarascon tenait beaucoup de place....
La reponse du petit monsieur le facha: "Vous imaginez-vous par hasard que je vais aller au lion avec votre parapluie?" dit le grand homme fierement.
Page soixante-douze Le petit monsieur regarda son parapluie, sourit doucement; puis, toujours avec son meme flegme: "Alors, monsieur, vous etes...? --Tartarin de Tarascon, tueur de lions!" En prononcant ces mots, l'intrepide Tarasconnais secoua comme une criniere le gland de sa chechia.
Il y eut dans la diligence un mouvement de stupeur.
Le trappiste se signa, les cocottes pousserent de petits cris d'effroi, et le photographe d'Orleansville se rapprocha du tueur de lions, revant deja l'insigne honneur de faire sa photographie.
Le petit monsieur, lui, ne se deconcerta pas.
"Est-ce que vous avez deja tue beaucoup de lions, monsieur Tartarin?" demanda-t-il tres tranquillement.
Le Tarasconnais le recut de la belle maniere: "Si j'en ai beaucoup tue, monsieur!...
Je vous souhaiterais d'avoir seulement autant de cheveux sur la tete." Et toute la diligence de rire en regardant les trois cheveux jaunes de Cadet-Roussel qui se herissaient sur le crane du petit monsieur.
A son tour le photographe d'Orleansville prit la parole: "Terrible profession que la votre, monsieur Tartarin!...
On passe quelquefois de mauvais moments....
Ainsi ce pauvre Monsieur Bombonnel....
--Ah! oui, le tueur de pantheres ..." fit Tartarin assez dedaigneusement.
"Est-ce que vous le connaissez?" demanda le petit monsieur.
"Te! pardi....
Si je le connais....
Nous avons chasse plus de vingt fois ensemble." Le petit monsieur sourit: "Vous chassez donc la panthere aussi, monsieur Tartarin? --Quelquefois, par passe-temps, ..." fit l'enrage Tarasconnais.
Il ajouta, en relevant la tete d'un geste heroique qui enflamma le coeur des deux cocottes: "Ca ne vaut pas le lion! Page soixante-treize --En somme," hasarda le photographe d'Orleansville, "une panthere, ce n'est qu'un gros chat....
--Tout juste!" fit Tartarin qui n'etait pas fache de rabaisser un peu la gloire de Bombonnel, surtout devant des dames.
Ici la diligence s'arreta, le conducteur vint ouvrir la portiere et s'adressant au petit vieux: "Vous voila arrive, monsieur," lui dit-il d'un air tres respectueux.
Le petit monsieur se leva, descendit, puis avant de refermer la portiere: "Voulez-vous me permettre de vous donner un conseil, monsieur Tartarin? --Lequel, monsieur? --Ma foi! ecoutez, vous avez un'air d'un brave homme, j'aime mieux vous dire ce qu'il en est....
Retournez vite a Tarascon, monsieur Tartarin....
Vous perdez votre temps ici....
Il reste bien encore quelques pantheres dans la province; mais, fi donc! c'est un trop petit gibier pour vous....
Quant aux lions, c'est fini.
Il n'en reste plus en Algerie ...
mon ami Chassaing vient de tuer le dernier." Sur quoi le petit monsieur salua, ferma la portiere, et s'en alla en riant avec sa serviette et son parapluie.
"Conducteur," demanda Tartarin en faisant sa moue, "qu'est-ce que c'est donc que ce bonhomme-la? --Comment! vous ne le connaissez pas? mais c'est monsieur Bombonnel." Un couvent de lions.
A Milianah, Tartarin de Tarascon descendit, laissant la diligence continuer sa route vers le Sud.
Deux jours de durs cahots, deux nuits passees les yeux ouverts a regarder par la portiere s'il n'apercevrait pas dans les Page soixante-quatorze champs, au bord de la route, l'ombre formidable du lion, tant d'insomnies meritaient bien quelques heures de repos.
Et puis, s'il faut tout dire, depuis sa mesaventure avec Bombonnel, le loyal Tarasconnais se sentait mal a l'aise, malgre ses armes, sa moue terrible, son bonnet rouge, devant le photographe d'Orleansville et les deux demoiselles du troisième hussards.
Il se dirigea donc a travers les larges rues de Milianah, pleines de beaux arbres et de fontaines, mais, tout en cherchant un hotel a sa convenance, le pauvre homme ne pouvait s'empecher de songer aux paroles de Bombonnel....
Si c'etait vrai pourtant? S'il n'y avait plus de lions en Algerie?...
A quoi bon alors tant de courses, tant de fatigues?...
Soudain, au detour d'une rue, notre heros se trouva face a face ...
avec qui? Devinez....
Avec un lion superbe, qui attendait devant la porte d'un cafe, assis royalement sur son train de derriere, sa criniere fauve dans le soleil.
"Qu'est ce qu'ils me disaient donc qu'il n'y en avait plus?" s'ecria le Tarasconnais en faisant un saut en arriere....
En entendant cette exclamation, le lion baissa la tete et, prenant dans sa gueule une sebile en bois posee devant lui sur le trottoir, il la tendit humblement du cote de Tartarin immobile de Stupeur....
Un Arabe qui passait jeta un gros sou dans la sebile, le lion remua la queue....
Alors Tartarin comprit tout.
Il vit, ce que l'emotion l'avait d'abord empeche de voir, la foule attroupee autour du pauvre lion aveugle et apprivoise, et les deux grands negres armes de gourdins qui le promenaient a travers la ville comme un Savoyard sa marmotte.
Le sang du Tarasconnais ne fit qu'un tour "Miserables," cria-t-il d'une voix de tonnerre, "ravaler ainsi ces nobles betes!" Et, s'elancant sur le lion, il lui arracha l'immonde sebile d'entre ses royales machoires....
Les deux negres, croyant avoir affaire a un voleur, se precipiterent sur le Tarasconnais, la matraque haute....
Ce fut une terrible bousculade....
Les Page soixante-quinze negres tapaient, les femmes piaillaient, les enfants riaient.
Un vieux cordonnier juif criait du fond de sa boutique.
"Au zouge de paix! Au zouge de paix!" Le lion lui-meme, dans sa nuit, essaya d'un rugissement, et le malheureux Tartarin, apres une lutte desesperee, roula par terre au milieu des gros sous et des balayures.
A ce moment, un homme fendit la foule, ecarta les negres d'un mot, les femmes et les enfants d'un geste, releva Tartarin, le brossa, le secoua, et l'assit tout essouffle sur une borne.
"Comment! preince, c'est vous?..." fit le bon Tartarin en se frottant les cotes.
"Eh! oui, mon vaillant ami, c'est moi....
Sitot votre lettre recue, j'ai confie Baia a son frere, loue une chaise de poste, fait cinquante lieues ventre a terre, et me voila juste a temps pour vous arracher a la brutalite de ces rustres....
Qu'est-ce que vous avez donc fait, juste Dieu! pour vous attirer cette mechante affaire? --Que voulez vous, preince?...
De voir ce malheureux lion avec sa sebile aux dents, humilie, vaincu, bafoue, servant de risee a toute cette pouillerie musulmane....
--Mais vous vous trompez, mon noble ami.
Ce lion est, au contraire, pour eux un objet de respect et d'adoration.
"Ce qui me va dans tout ceci," fit-il en matiere de conclusion, "c'est que, n'en deplaise a mons Bombonnel, il y a encore des lions en Algerie!...
--S'il y en a!" dit le prince avec enthousiasme....
"Des demain, nous allons battre la plaine du Cheliff, et vous verrez!....
--Eh quoi! Prince....
Auriez-vous l'intention de chasser, vous aussi? --Parbleu! pensez-vous donc que je vous laisserais vous en aller seul en pleine Afrique, au milieu de ces tribus feroces dont vous ignorez la langue et les usages....
Non! non! illustre Tartarin, je ne vous quitte plus....
Partout ou vous serez, je veux etre.
--Oh! preince, preince...." Et Tartarin, radieux, pressa sur son coeur le vaillant Gregory, en songeant avec fierte qu'a l'exemple de Jules Gerard, de Bombonnel et tous les autres fameux tueurs de lions, il allait avoir un prince etranger pour l'accompagner dans ses chasses.
La caravane en marche.
Un paysage du Liban.
Il suffit d'un kepi, d'un beau kepi galonne, reluisant au bout d'une trique comme la toque de Gessler.
Ainsi causant et philosophant, la caravane allait son train.
Les portefaix--pieds nus--sautaient de roche en roche avec des cris de singes.
Les caisses d'armes sonnaient.
Les fusils flambaient.
Les indigenes qui passaient s'inclinaient jusqu'a terre devant le kepi magique....
Beau debut pour la caravane! Malheureusement, avant la fin du jour, les choses se gaterent.
Des negres qui portaient les bagages, l'un fut pris d'atroces coliques pour avoir mange le sparadrap de la pharmacie.
Un autre tomba sur le bord de la route ivre mort d'eau-de-vie camphree.
Le troisieme, celui qui portait l'album de voyage, seduit Page soixante-dix-huit par les dorures des fermoirs, et persuade qu'il enlevait les tresors de la Mecque, se sauva dans le Zaccar a toutes jambes....
Il fallut aviser....
La caravane fit halte, et tint conseil dans l'ombre trouee d'un vieux figuier.
Je serais d'avis, dit le prince, en essayant, mais sans succes, de delayer une tablette de pemmican dans une casserole perfectionnee a triple fond, je serais d'avis que, des ce soir, nous renoncions aux porteurs negres....
Il y a precisement un marche arabe tout pres d'ici.
Le mieux est de nous y arreter, et de faire emplette de quelques bourriquots....
--Non!...
non!...
pas de bourriquots!..." interrompit vivement le grand Tartarin, que le souvenir de Noiraud avait fait devenir tout rouge.
Et il ajouta, l'hypocrite: "Comment voulez-vous que de si petites betes puissent porter tout notre attirail?" Le prince sourit.
"C'est ce qui vous trompe, mon illustre ami.
Si maigre et si chetif qu'il vous paraisse, le bourriquot algerien a les reins solides....
Il le faut bien pour supporter tout ce qu'il supporte....
Demandez plutot aux Arabes.
Voici comment ils expliquent notre organisation coloniale....
Vous voyez bien qu'il peut porter vos caisses.
--C'est egal," reprit Tartarin de Tarascon, "je trouve que, pour le coup d'oeil de notre caravane, des anes ne feraient pas tres bien....
Je voudrais quelque chose de plus oriental....
Ainsi, par exemple, si nous pouvions avoir un chameau....
Page soixante-dix-neuf --Tant que vous en voudrez," fit l'Altesse, et l'on se mit en route pour le marche arabe.
Le marche se tenait a quelques kilometres, sur les bords du Cheliff....
Dans un coin, sous une tente rapetassee de mille couleurs, un greffier maure, avec un grand livre et des lunettes.
Ici, un groupe, des cris de rage: c'est un jeu de roulette, installe sur une mesure a ble, et des Kabyles, qui s'eventrent autour....
La-bas, des trepignements, une joie, des rires: c'est un marchand juif avec sa mule, qu'on regarde se noyer dans le Cheliff....
Puis des scorpions, des chiens, des corbeaux, et des mouches!...
des mouches!...
Par exemple, les chameaux manquaient.
On finit pourtant par en decouvrir un, dont des M'zabites cherchaient a se defaire.
C'etait le vrai chameau du desert, le chameau classique, chauve, l'air triste, avec sa longue tete de bedouin et sa bosse qui, devenue flasque par suite de trop longs jeunes, pendait melancoliquement sur le cote.
Tartarin le trouva si beau, qu'il voulut que la caravane entiere montat dessus....
Toujours la folie orientale!...
La bete s'accroupit.
On sangla les malles.
Le prince s'installa sur le cou de l'animal.
Tartarin, pour plus de majeste, se fit hisser tout en haut de la bosse, entre deux caisses; et la, fier et bien cale, saluant d'un geste noble tout le marche accouru, il donna le signal du depart....
Tonnerre! si ceux de Tarascon avaient pu le voir!...
Page quatre-vingts Le chameau se redressa, allongea ses grandes jambes a noeuds, et prit son vol....
O stupeur! Au bout de quelques enjambees, voila Tartarin qui se sent palir, et l'heroique chechia qui reprend une a une ses anciennes positions du temps du Zouave.
Ce diable de chameau tanguait comme une fregate.
"Preince, preince," murmura Tartarin tout bleme, et s'accrochant a l'etoupe seche de la bosse, "preince, descendons....
Je sens ...
je sens ...
que je vais faire bafouer la France...." Va te promener! le chameau etait lance, et rien ne pouvait plus l'arreter.
Quatre mille Arabes couraient derriere, pieds nus, gesticulant, riant comme des fous, et faisant luire au soleil six cent mille dents blanches....
Le grand homme de Tarascon dut se resigner.
Il s'affaissa tristement sur la bosse.
La chechia prit toutes les positions qu'elle voulut ...
et la France fut bafouee.
L'affut du soir dans un bois de lauriers-roses.
Si pittoresque que fut leur nouvelle monture, nos tueurs de lions durent y renoncer, par egard pour la chechia.
On continua donc la route a pied comme devant, et la caravane s'en alla tranquillement vers le Sud par petites etapes, le Tarasconnais en tete, le Montenegrin en queue, et dans les rangs le chameau avec les caisses d'armes.
L'expedition dura pres d'un mois.
Curieux spectacle pour des yeux qui auraient su voir....
Un peuple sauvage et pourri que nous civilisons, en lui donnant nos vices....
L'autorite feroce et sans controle de bachagas fantastiques, qui se mouchent gravement dans leurs grands cordons de la Legion d'honneur, et pour un oui ou pour un non font batonner les gens sur la plante des pieds.
Puis, tout autour, des plaines en friche, de l'herbe brulee, des buissons chauves, des maquis de cactus et de lentisques, le grenier de la France!...
Grenier vide de grains, helas! et riche seulement en chacals et en punaises.
Des douars abandonnes, des tribus effarees qui s'en vont sans savoir ou, fuyant la faim, et semant des cadavres le long de la route.
Page quatre-vingt-deux Comme la tente-abri s'entetait a ne pas s'ouvrir et les tablettes de pemmican a ne pas fondre, la caravane etait obligee de s'arreter matin et soir dans les tribus.
Partout, grace au kepi du prince Gregory, nos chasseurs etaient recus a bras ouverts.
Partout on donnait a Tartarin des fetes splendides, des diffas, des fantasias....
En son honneur, des goums entiers faisaient parler la poudre et luire leurs burnous au soleil.
Puis, quand la poudre avait parle, le bon aga venait et presentait sa note....
C'est ce qu'on appelle l'hospitalite arabe.
Et toujours pas de lions.
Pas plus de lions que sur le Pont-Neuf! Cependant le Tarasconnais ne se decourageait pas.
S'enfoncant bravement dans le Sud, il passait ses journees a battre le maquis, fouillant les palmiers-nains du bout de sa carabine, et faisant "frrt! frrt!" a chaque buisson.
Puis, tous les soirs avant de se coucher, un petit affut de deux ou trois heures....
Peine perdue! le lion ne se montrait pas.
D'abord le heros croyait rever....
Plus de doute.
C'etait le lion....
Vite, vite, a l'affut.
Pas une minute a perdre.
Tartarin de Tarascon y remisa son prince et son chameau et se mit en quete d'un affut.
Le prince Gregory voulait le suivre, mais le Tarasconnais s'y refusa; il tenait a affronter le lion seul a seul.
Toutefois il recommanda a Son Altesse de ne pas s'eloigner, et, par mesure de precaution, il lui confia son portefeuille, un gros portefeuille plein de papiers precieux et de billets de banque, qu'il craignait de faire ecornifler par la griffe du lion.
Ceci fait, le heros chercha son poste.
Cent pas en avant du marabout, un petit bois de lauriers-roses tremblait dans la gaze du crepuscule, au bord d'une riviere presque a sec.
C'est la que Tartarin vint s'embusquer, le genou en terre, selon la formule, la carabine au poing et son grand couteau de chasse plante fierement devant lui dans le sable de la berge.
La nuit arriva.
Le rose de la nature passa au violet, puis au bleu sombre....
En bas, dans les cailloux de la riviere, luisait comme un miroir a main une petite flaque d'eau claire.
C'etait l'abreuvoir des fauves.
Sur la pente de l'autre berge, on voyait vaguement le sentier blanc que leurs grosses pattes avaient trace dans les lentisques.
Cette pente mysterieuse donnait le frisson.
Tartarin l'etait.
Il l'etait meme beaucoup.
Les dents lui claquaient, le pauvre homme! Et sur la garde de son couteau de chasse plante en terre le canon de son fusil raye sonnait comme une paire de castagnettes....
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez! Il y a des soirs ou l'on n'est pas en train, et puis ou serait le merite, si les heros n'avaient jamais peur....
Eh bien! oui, Tartarin eut peur, et tout le temps encore.
Neanmoins, il tint bon une heure, deux heures, mais l'heroisme a ses limites....
Pres de lui, dans le lit desseche de la riviere, le Tarasconnais entend tout a coup un bruit de pas, des cailloux qui roulent.
Cette fois la terreur l'enleve de terre.
Il tire ses deux coups au hasard dans la nuit, et se replie a toutes jambes sur le marabout, laissant son coutelas debout dans le sable comme une croix commemorative de la plus formidable panique qui ait jamais assailli l'ame d'un dompteur d'hydres.
"A moi, preince ...
le lion! ..." Un silence.
"Preince, preince, etes-vous la?" Le prince n'etait pas la.
Sur le mur blanc du marabout, le bon chameau projetait seul au clair de lune l'ombre bizarre de sa bosse....
Le prince Gregory venait de filer en emportant portefeuille et billets de banque....
Il y avait un mois que Son Altesse attendait cette occasion....
Enfin!...
Il douta du Montenegro, il douta de l'amitie, il douta de la gloire, il douta meme des lions, et, comme le Christ a Gethsemani, le grand homme se prit a pleurer amerement.
Seul, le Tarasconnais ne trembla pas.
"Enfin!" cria-t-il en bondissant, la crosse a l'epaule....
Pan!...
pan! pfft! pfft! C'etait fait....
Le lion avait deux balles explosibles dans la tete....
Pendant une minute, sur le fond embrase du ciel africain, ce fut un feu d'artifice epouvantable de cervelle en eclats, de sang fumant et de toison rousse eparpillee.
Puis tout retomba et Tartarin apercut ...
deux grands negres furieux qui couraient sur lui, la matraque en l'air.
Les deux negres de Milianah! O misere! c'etait le lion apprivoise, le pauvre aveugle du couvent de Mohammed que les balles tarasconnaises venaient d'abattre.
Page quatre-vingt-six Cette fois, par Mahom! Tartarin l'echappa belle.
Ivres de fureur fanatique, les deux negres queteurs l'auraient surement mis en pieces, si le Dieu des chretiens n'avait envoye a son aide un ange liberateur, le garde champetre de la commune d'Orleansville arrivant, son sabre sous le bras, par un petit sentier.
La vue du kepi municipal calma subitement la colere des negres.
Paisible et majestueux, l'homme a la plaque dressa proces-verbal de l'affaire, fit charger sur le chameau ce qui restait du lion, ordonna aux plaignants comme au delinquant de le suivre, et se dirigea sur Orleansville, ou le tout fut depose au greffe.
Ce fut une longue et terrible procedure! Apres l'Algerie des tribus, qu'il venait de parcourir, Tartarin de Tarascon connut alors une autre Algerie non moins cocasse et formidable, l'Algerie des villes, processive et avocassiere.
Avant tout il s'agissait de savoir si le lion avait ete tue sur le territoire civil ou le territoire militaire.
Dans le premier cas l'affaire regardait le tribunal de commerce; dans le second, Tartarin relevait du conseil de guerre, et, a ce mot de conseil de guerre, l'impressionnable Tarasconnais se voyait deja fusille au pied des remparts, ou croupissant dans le fond d'un silo....
Le terrible, c'est que la delimitation des deux territoires est tres vague en Algerie....
Enfin, apres un mois de courses, d'intrigues, de stations au soleil dans les cours des bureaux arabes, il fut etabli que si d'une part le lion avait ete tue sur le territoire militaire, d'autre part, Tartarin, lorsqu'il tira, se trouvait sur le territoire civil.
L'affaire se jugea donc au civil, Page quatre-vingt-sept et notre heros en fut quitte pour deux mille cinq cents francs d'indemnite, sans les frais.
Comment faire pour payer tout cela? Les quelques piastres echappees a la razzia du prince s'en etaient allees depuis longtemps en papiers legaux et en absinthes judiciaires.
Le malheureux tueur de lions fut donc reduit a vendre la caisse d'armes au detail, carabine par carabine.
Il vendit les poignards, les kriss malais, les casse-tete....
Un epicier acheta les conserves alimentaires.
Un pharmacien, ce qui restait du sparadrap.
Les grandes bottes elles-memes y passerent et suivirent la tente-abri perfectionnee chez un marchand de bric-a-brac, qui les eleva a la hauteur de curiosites cochinchinoises....
Une fois tout paye, il ne restait plus a Tartarin que la peau du lion et le chameau.
La peau, il l'emballa soigneusement et la dirigea sur Tarascon, a l'adresse du brave commandant Bravida.
Malheureusement la bete etait d'un placement difficile, et personne n'en offrit un liard.
Tartarin cependant voulait regagner Alger a toute force.
Il avait hate de revoir le corselet bleu de Baia, sa maisonnette, ses fontaines, et de se reposer sur les trefles blancs de son petit cloitre, en attendant de l'argent de France.
Aussi notre heros n'hesita pas: et navre, mais point abattu, il entreprit de faire la route a pied, sans argent, par petites journees.
En cette occurrence, le chameau ne l'abandonna pas.
Cet etrange animal s'etait pris pour son maitre d'une tendresse inexplicable, et, le voyant sortir d'Orleansville, se mit a marcher religieusement derriere lui, reglant son pas sur le sien et ne le quittant pas d'une semelle.
Page quatre-vingt-huit Au premier moment, Tartarin trouva cela touchant, cette fidelite, ce devouement a toute epreuve lui allaient au coeur, d'autant que la bete etait commode et se nourrissait avec rien.
Pourtant, au bout de quelques jours, le Tarasconnais s'ennuya d'avoir perpetuellement sur les talons ce compagnon melancolique, qui lui rappelait toutes ses mesaventures, puis, l'aigreur s'en melant, il lui en voulut de son air triste, de sa bosse, de son allure d'oie bridee.
Pour tout dire, il le prit en grippe et ne songea plus qu'a s'en debarrasser, mais l'animal tenait bon....
Tartarin essaya de le perdre, le chameau le retrouva; il essaya de courir, le chameau courut plus vite....
Il lui criait: "Va t'en!" en lui jetant des pierres.
Le chameau s'arretait et le regardait d'un air triste, puis, au bout d'un moment, il se remettait en route et finissait toujours par le rattraper.
Tartarin dut se resigner.
"Non! non!" dit-il, "ce n'est pas possible....
Alors, soulage d'un grand poids, le heros sortit de sa cachette, et rentra dans la ville par un sentier detourne qui longeait le mur de son petit clos.
Catastrophes sur catastrophes.
Page quatre-vingt-neuf En arrivant devant sa maison mauresque, Tartarin s'arreta tres etonne.
Le jour tombait, la rue etait deserte.
"Tron de Diou!" fit le Tarasconnais en palissant, et il se precipita dans la cour.
Malheureux Tartarin! Quel spectacle l'attendait....
A ses pieds, sur une natte, gave d'amour et de confitures, Barbassou, l'infame capitaine Barbassou, se crevait de rire en l'ecoutant.
L'apparition de Tartarin, have, maigri, poudreux, les yeux flamboyants, la chechia herissee, interrompit tout net cette aimable orgie turco-marseillaise.
Baia poussa un petit cri de levrette effrayee, et se sauva dans la maison.
Barbassou, lui, ne se troubla pas, et riant de plus belle: "He! be! monsieur Tartarin, qu'est-ce que vous en dites? Vous voyez bien qu'elle savait le francais!" Tartarin de Tarascon s'avanca furieux.
"Capitaine! --Digo-li que vengue, moun bon!" cria la Mauresque, se penchant de la galerie du premier avec un joli geste canaille.
Page quatre-vingt-dix Le pauvre homme, atterre, se laissa choir sur un tambour.
Sa Mauresque savait meme le marseillais! "Quand je vous disais de vous mefier des Algeriennes!" fit sentencieusement le capitaine Barbassou.
"C'est comme votre prince montenegrin." Tartarin releva la tete.
"Vous savez ou est le prince? --Oh! il n'est pas loin.
Il habite pour cinq ans la belle prison de Mustapha.
Le drole s'est laisse prendre la main dans le sac....
Du reste, ce n'est pas la premiere fois qu'on le met a l'ombre.
Son Altesse a deja fait trois ans de maison centrale quelque part ...
et, tenez! je crois meme que c'est a Tarascon.
--A Tarascon!..." s'ecria Tartarin subitement illumine....
"C'est donc ca qu'il ne connaissait qu'un cote de la ville....
--He! sans doute ...
Tarascon, vu de la maison centrale....
Ah! mon pauvre monsieur Tartarin, il faut joliment ouvrir l'oeil dans ce diable de pays, sans quoi on est expose a des choses bien desagreables....
Ainsi votre histoire avec le muezzin....
--Quelle histoire? quel muezzin? --Te! pardi!...
le muezzin d'en face qui faisait la cour a Baia....
L'Akbar a raconte l'affaire l'autre jour, et tout Alger en rit encore....
C'est si drole ce muezzin qui, du haut de sa tour, tout en chantant ses prieres, faisait sous votre nez des declarations a la petite, et lui donnait des rendez-vous en invoquant le nom d'Allah....
--Mais c'est donc tous des gredins dans ce pays?..." hurla le malheureux Tarasconnais.
Barbassou eut un geste de philosophe.
"Mon cher, vous savez, les pays neufs....
C'est egal! si vous m'en croyez, vous retournerez bien vite a Tarascon.
--Retourner ...
c'est facile a dire....
Et l'argent?...
Vous ne savez donc pas comme ils m'ont plume, la-has, dans le desert? Page quatre-vingt-onze --Qu'a cela ne tienne!" fit le capitaine en riant....
"Le Zouave part demain, et si vous voulez, je vous rapatrie ...
ca vous va-t-il, collegue?...
Alors, tres bien.
Vous n'avez plus qu'une chose a faire.
Il reste encore quelques fioles de champagne, une moitie de croustade ...
asseyez-vous la, et sans rancune!..." Apres la minute d'hesitation que lui commandait sa dignite, le Tarasconnais prit bravement son parti.
Il s'assit, on trinqua; Baia, redescendue au bruit des verres, chanta la fin de Marco la Belle, et la fete se prolongea fort avant dans la nuit.
La porte etait ouverte.
Il entra, suivit de longs couloirs tapisses de nattes, monta, monta encore, et finit par se trouver dans un petit oratoire turc, ou une lanterne en fer decoupe se balancait au plafond, brodant les murs blancs d'ombres bizarres.
Le muezzin etait la, assis sur un divan, avec son gros turban, sa pelisse blanche, sa pipe de Mostaganem, et devant un grand verre d'absinthe fraiche, qu'il battait religieusement, en attendant l'heure d'appeler les croyants a la priere....
A la vue de Tartarin, il lacha sa pipe de terreur.
"Pas un mot, cure," fit le Tarasconnais, qui avait son idee....
"Vite, ton turban, ta pelisse!..." Le cure turc, tout tremblant, donna son turban, sa pelisse, tout ce qu'on voulut.
Tartarin s'en affubla, et passa gravement sur la terrasse du minaret.
La mer luisait au loin.
Les toits blancs etincelaient au clair de lune.
On entendait dans la brise marine quelques guitares attardees....
Le muezzin de Tarascon se recueillit un moment, puis, levant les bras, il commenca a psalmodier d'une voix suraigue: Page quatre-vingt-douze "La Allah il Allah....
Mahomet est un vieux farceur.,..
L'Orient, le Coran, les bachagas, les lions, les Mauresques, tout ca ne vaut pas un viedaze!...
Il n'y a plus de Teurs....
Il n'y a que des carotteurs....
Tarascon! Tarascon! Midi.
Le Zouave chauffe, on va partir.
La-haut, sur le balcon du cafe Valentin, MMonsieur les officiers braquent la longue-vue, et viennent, colonel en tete, par rang de grade, regarder l'heureux petit bateau qui va en France.
C'est la grande distraction de l'etat-major....
En has, la rade etincelle.
La culasse des vieux canons turcs enterres le long du quai flambe au soleil.
Les passagers se pressent.
Biskris et Mahonnais entassent les bagages dans les barques.
Tartarin de Tarascon, lui, n'a pas de bagages.
Le voici qui descend de la rue de la Marine, par le petit marche, plein de bananes et de pasteques, accompagne de son ami Barbassou.
Le malheureux Tarasconnais a laisse sur la rive du Maure sa caisse d'armes et ses illusions, et maintenant il s'apprete a voguer vers Tarascon, les mains dans ses poches....
A peine vient-il de sauter dans la chaloupe du capitaine, qu'une bete essoufflee degringole du haut de la place, et se precipite vers lui, en galopant.
C'est le chameau, le chameau fidele, qui, depuis vingt-quatre heures, cherche son maitre dans Alger.
Page quatre-vingt-treize Tartarin, en le voyant, change de couleur et feint de ne pas le connaitre; mais le chameau s'acharne.
Il fretille au long du quai.
Il appelle son ami, et le regarde avec tendresse: "Emmene-moi," semble dire son oeil triste, "emmene-moi dans la barque, loin, bien loin de cette Arabie en carton peint, de cet Orient ridicule, plein de locomotives et de diligences, ou--dromadaire declasse--je ne sais plus que devenir.
Tu es le dernier Turc, je suis le dernier chameau....
Ne nous quittons plus, o mon Tartarin....
--Est-ce que ce chameau est a vous?" demande le capitaine.
"Pas du tout!" repond Tartarin, qui fremit a l'idee d'entrer dans Tarascon avec cette escorte ridicule; et, reniant impudemment le compagnon de ses infortunes, il repousse du pied le sol algerien, et donne a la barque l'elan du depart....
Barque et chameau viennent ensemble se ranger aux flancs du paquebot.
"A la fin, il me fait peine, ce dromadaire!" dit le capitaine Barbassou tout emu, "j'ai envie de le prendre a mon bord....
En arrivant a Marseille, j'en ferai hommage an Jardin zoologique." On hissa sur le pont, a grand renfort de palans et de cordes, le chameau, alourdi par l'eau de mer, et le Zouave se mit en route.
Vous n'avez jamais vu un chameau afficher quelqu'un comme cela!...
Page quatre-vingt-quatorze D'heure en heure, par les hublots de la cabine ou il mettait le nez quelquefois, Tartarin vit le bleu du ciel algerien palir; puis, enfin, un matin, dans une brume d'argent, il entendit avec bonheur chanter toutes les cloches de Marseille.
On etait arrive ...
le Zouave jeta l'ancre.
Notre homme, qui n'avait pas de bagages, descendit sans rien dire, traversa Marseille en hate, craignant toujours d'etre suivi par le chameau, et ne respira que lorsqu'il se vit installe dans un wagon de troisieme classe, filant bon train sur Tarascon....
Securite trompeuse! A peine a deux lieues de Marseille, voila toutes les tetes aux portieres.
On crie, on s'etonne.
Tartarin, a son tour, regarde, et ...
qu'apercoit-il?...
Le chameau, monsieur, l'inevitable chameau, qui detalait sur les rails, en pleine Crau, derriere le train, et lui tenant pied.
Tartarin, consterne, se rencoigna, en fermant les yeux.
Apres cette expedition desastreuse, il avait compte rentrer chez lui incognito.
Mais la presence de ce quadrupede encombrant rendait la chose impossible.
Quelle rentree il allait faire, bon Dieu! Pas le son, pas de lions, rien.
Un chameau!...
"Tarascon!...
Tarascon!..." Il fallut descendre....
O stupeur! a peine la chechia du heros apparut-elle dans l'ouverture de la portiere, un grand cri: "Vive Tartarin!" fit trembler les voutes vitrees de la gare.--"Vive Tartarin! vive le tueur de lions!" Et des fanfares, des choeurs d'orpheons eclaterent....
Tartarin se sentit mourir; il croyait a une mystification.
Mais non! tout Tarascon etait la, chapeaux en l'air, et sympathique.
Voila le brave commandant Bravida, l'armurier Costecalde, le president, le pharmacien, et tout le noble corps des chasseurs de casquettes qui se presse autour de son chef, et le porte en triomphe tout le long des escaliers....
Page quatre-vingt-quinze Singuliers effets du mirage! la peau du lion aveugle, envoyee a Bravida, etait cause de tout ce bruit.
Avec cette modeste fourrure, exposee au cercle, les Tarasconnais, et derriere eux tout le Midi, s'etaient monte la tete.
Le Semaphore avait parle.
On avait invente un drame.
Ce n'etait plus un lion que Tartarin avait tue, c'etaient dix lions, vingt lions, une marmelade de lions! Aussi Tartarin, debarquant a Marseille, y etait deja illustre sans le savoir, et un telegramme enthousiaste un'avait devance de deux heures dans sa ville natale.
Mais ce qui mit le comble a la joie populaire, ce fut quand on vit un animal fantastique, couvert de poussiere et de sueur, apparaitre derriere le heros, et descendre a cloche-pied l'escalier de la gare.
Tarascon crut un instant sa Tarasque revenue.
Tartarin rassura ses compatriotes.
"C'est mon chameau," dit-il.
Et deja sous l'influence du soleil tarasconnais, ce beau soleil qui fait mentir ingenument, il ajouta, en caressant la bosse du dromadaire: "C'est une noble bete!...
Dedication Gonzague-Privat (Louis de): painter, art critic and novelist, born at Montpellier in mille huit cent quarante-trois.
Daudet wrote a preface for his "Joie perdue" (mille huit cent quatre-vingt-treize).
un un Tarascon: a very old city (population neuf) on the east bank of the Rhone, opposite Beaucaire (cf.
note to treize_vingt-huit), about fifty miles northwest of Marseilles.
To Daudet the choice of proper names was always a matter for careful consideration.
Tarascon was not the home of the original Tartarin (see Introduction, p.
note to _trois cent vingt-cinq.
un deux il y a ...
de cela: 'that was ...

'there are ...
from that.' un trois je m'en souviens: 'un remember it.' Se souvenir de quelque chose, hence s'en souvenir (en replacing de + a pronoun); cf.
changer de chanson, en changer sept cinq, revenir de la-bas, en revenir seize douze.
un quatre habitait: 'was living in.' Be careful to give the imperfect its progressive force wherever possible.
un cinq le chemin d'Avignon: 'the Avignon road.' Note that an English noun used adjectively is usually replaced in French by de + noun, the student should be careful to translate une robe de soie 'a silk dress' and not 'a dress of silk'; cf.
de petits soldats de plomb (soixante et onze quatre) 'little lead soldiers,' l'eau de mer (quatre-vingt-treize_vingt-six) 'the sea water', _cinquante-deux_vingt-cinq, _soixante-dix-neuf_vingt-trois.
For _une voix de femme (quatre-vingt-neuf cinq) we cannot say 'a woman voice,' but must say 'the voice of a woman,' 'woman' not being a possible noun-adjective here; still voix de femme is a noun-phrase modified by une; cf.
un six: devant: adverb, 'in front'; cf.

For the construction cf.
coquin de lievre quatre vingt-quatre, diable d'homme neuf trois.

notes to quarante-trois vingt, vingt-neuf.
deux onze: mirifique: a mock-heroic synonym for merveilleux.--bien autre: bien in its common intensive use, 'quite.' Bien frequently adds to a passage a shade of meaning which can be rendered in English only by a complete remodeling of the sentence, e.g.

Qui leur en achete? dix.
Qu'est-ce qu'il y a dans les greniers? Great men are bored the rest of the time.
It's enough to make you die of excitement.
The fact is that a heroic soul like mine will scarcely enlarge its horizon at Tarascon.
He will seek to tear himself from his dream.
In the long run all he does to forget reality will serve only to keep him in a state of anger.
Do not give me bad advice.
He did nothing to alleviate his thirst for adventures.

How ('comment') does it happen that he has never left? cinq.
He almost left Tarascon once.

However, he never offered it to him.

Quelle est la vie qu'il lui faut? At last he will come and stand before him.
They are face to face.
They looked at each other.
Both were standing, Tartarin on one side, the lion on the other.
Up to that time he had not yawned in his face.
He rose with an air of supreme contempt.
At first he was stupefied, but after a moment he rushed toward the door.
Do not stir.
The women themselves were somewhat reassured by his resolute attitude and approached the cage.
Say no more.

He had been gone from Tartarin for more than three months.
Don't move! huit.
They imagined they had gone to Algeria.
After three months of waiting he began to pack his trunk.
When these (the latter) fired a shot, those (the former) closed their eyes.

Comment est-ce que les Tarasconnais out fait voir qu'ils ne croyaient plus a Tartarin? neuf.
Qui etaient impitoyables? Qu'est-ce qu'un poltron ne peut pas faire? Suddenly he appeared on the threshold of the garden-gate.
He thought it his duty to offer some explanation.
His head was bare, and he wore wide trousers of white linen.
There was a great movement among the crowd.
un beg your pardon, that is not all; you have forgotten that there was also a long blue tassel.
Besides, my eye-glasses bother me.
They obliged him to leave his pretty little home.
He was proud, but it was not apparent.
He did not turn, for at the bottom of his heart he cursed them.

Qu'a-t-il fait apres avoir quitte sa maison? My reader would like to put the crossing of a great painter at the head of this episode.
Show me it first on board the Zouave, then show me how it was when Tartarin felt the first pangs.
Put it before my eyes.
In three days one can make the voyage from France to Algeria.
un shall show it to you struggling with the waves.
It begins to stand erect on the hero's skull.
As you go farther into the open sea, the coast begins to look like something formless.
He is in the depths of his narrow cabin.
At the departure of the Zouave the sea became more rough.
As the boat left the port Tartarin went and leaned over the rail.
Voulez-vous me dire ce que c'est qu'un Teur? deux.

What is floating in the air is not what you think.
Who are on the shore? cinq.
un can scarcely see what there is in the nets which the sailors are pulling in.
There was a Moor smoking his pipe on the quay.
He rose from among the stones, threw himself on Tartarin, and clung to his clothes.

Pourquoi ne pouvait-il pas se faire comprendre? dix.
Quelles langues pouvait-il parler? There were wild beasts here, but they did not wait for Tartarin.
He remembered that he had not brought along a kid.
Great lion-hunters pull the kid's foot with a string.
Nothing came all the same.
Not being afraid, Tartarin cried louder.
Something black stooped in front of him.
That is surely a lion! huit.
Suddenly Tartarin became silent.
Nothing answered the shot.
He was afraid and made a leap backward.
Qu'y a-t-il a gauche? deux.
Comment Tartarin attendait-il le lion? Qu'est-ce que les grands tueurs de lions faisaient? quatre.

Tartarin got into the first omnibus that passed.
He perceived that there was a sailor at the back of the omnibus smoking cigarettes.
Opposite him there were some young Moorish women whose eyes he could not see.
The one who was sitting there thought she noticed that he was looking at her.
He had just spoken to the Maltese merchant with the heavy black beard at the risk of hearing him laugh.
From time to time he was cold.
What was he to do? dix.
The eyes whose glance answered his were large and black.

Est-ce qu'il a vu son poignet? neuf.
Qu'est-ce que ses mouvements disaient? dix.
Ou Tartarin s'est-il fourre? He ended by turning his eye toward the table.
Their eyes make the gold pieces frisk.
The guard comes up because there are knives unsheathed and money missing.
One evening he strayed into the middle of this crowd.
The hero was thinking of the peace of his heart, when suddenly angry voices rose.
un am twenty francs short.
un ask no better.
He was proud to make the acquaintance of the prince whose title had dazzled him.
He turned toward Tartarin sneering.
Tartarin made a step forward without producing the slightest impression upon the officer.
Quel etait l'effet des terribles yeux? deux.
Ou le heros tarasconnais est-il venu s'egarer? trois.

Qu'est-ce que l'officier a fait quand le prince a prononce son titre? dix.
Qu'a-t-il fait quand Tartarin a dit "Je connais le preince"? The negress appeared on seeing the door open.
He retired after having knocked twice at the postern.
The gentlemen were led across the narrow court.
The lady in question seems to me smaller.
As a matter of fact, the suspicion came to me that she was not the same.
She seemed to him so pretty through the smoke which enveloped her entirely! Tartarin bowed and placed his hand on his lips.
Baia dropped the amber mouthpiece without saying anything.
The only thing you ('on') could see any more was her white neck.
If you looked at her, she would laugh.
Qu'est-ce qu'Ali a fait? deux.
Qu'est-ce que la negresse a fait? Pourquoi semblait-il a Tartarin que ce n'etait pas la dame qu'il avait vue dans l'omnibus? quatre.

Depuis combien de temps Tartarin a-t-il quitte Alger? dix.
Comment les Maures causaient-ils entre eux? He refused to believe that, although the insinuation awakened melancholy in his great soul.
He found nobody who seemed ugly to him.
Sit down near the fountain, although you are a prey to remorse.
We hear from Tarascon that they have not heard from you for many months.
What has become of you? six.
So many of our fellow-countrymen gave some that un scarcely dare to ask them for it.
However, when they came to the fair they claimed to have known over there a man whose description tallied with his.
He was making for Paris.
When he had read that, Tartarin was ashamed of himself.
You think he is hunting lions in Africa.
En quittant Barbassou ou est-ce que Tartarin s'est dirige? deux.
Quel etait l'effet des jurons du capitaine? trois.

Nobody treats me well any more.
It's beginning again! quatre.
Instead of biting each other they would do well to take a roundabout way across the plains and stop at a farm.
If they did not fight, they would be able to make up lost time.
After which, he swam the river.
If you get wet, you will catch cold.
At night he feared the marauders, for he had to sleep under the open sky.
You could not lead the life un lead.
He could not do anything else.

Jusque quand la diligence continuera-t-elle a mener cette vie? dix.
Qu'est-ce que les Arabes en feront? After a desperate struggle a man broke through the crowd.
Tartarin himself was rolling on the ground.
He shook himself and sat down all out of breath.
As soon as he received the letter, he put aside the Arabs with a gesture.
What under the sun have you done? six.
You are mistaken; you are not a laughing-stock to the women and children.
On the contrary, you arrive just in time to get into an ugly difficulty.
He tried to rescue ('arracher') the lion from the hands of the strange monks who were taming him.
There are hundreds of them in the convent.
He belonged to that convent whose ('dont') friars receive gifts which they never steal.

A quoi servent les dons recus par les freres queteurs? dix.
Pourquoi les negres ont-ils montre tant d'humeur? After several strides the camel lengthened out his long knotty legs.
Tartarin picked himself up.
He felt himself grow pale, but had to resign himself.
Nothing could stop him any more.
One by one the Arabs gesticulated and laughed like madmen.
Tartarin clung to the hump and collapsed on it.
They had to give up the camel.
The old Orient had something fairy-like (about it), but nothing burlesque.
Out of consideration for Tartarin the prince wandered from plain to plain for nearly a month.
However bizarre their mount was, they felt that it was picturesque.
Qu'est-ce que le chameau a fait? deux.
Qu'est-ce qui est arrive a Tartarin et a la chechia au bout de quelques enjambees? trois.

Comment les parfums du vieil Orient se compliquent-ils? The hero awoke at dawn and saw that his treasure was gone.
The next day he saw that he had been robbed for the first time.
He began to weep bitterly.
Now, it was the prince that had deserted him in the heart of Africa.
He was sitting there with his head in his hands; suddenly he saw the camel looking at him.
Tartarin was stupefied on seeing the lion come forward.
He was ten paces from him, and made the saint's slippers tremble.
Everything was there in front of him.
Tartarin saw the big negroes running at him.
He had just slain the poor tame lion.

Apres le coup de fusil qu'a-t-on vu dans l'air? Qu'est-ce que Tartarin a apercu? dix.
Qu'est-ce que Tartarin a tue? Put not your trust in princes.
He raised his head and asked if the captain knew where the prince was.
un believe that he even let himself be caught.
Besides, un know he saw only the most disagreeable things.
Your affair with the prince is known; you must keep your eyes open mighty wide.
From the top of the penitentiary he could see only one side of the city.
Do that; otherwise he will see you somewhere.
He courted Baia from the top of the tower.
All that happened ('se passe') under Tartarin's nose.
If you'll take my advice, you'll return to ('en') France, for that is not the first time you have been fleeced.
Qu'est-ce que Tartarin a fait en apprenant que sa Mauresque savait meme le marseillais? deux.

Que faut-il faire en Algerie, d'apres le capitaine? huit.
Quelle est l'histoire du muezzin? neuf.
Quel conseil le capitaine donne-t-il a Tartarin? dix.
Pourquoi Tartarin ne pouvait-il pas suivre ce conseil? The strangest effect of the mirage is that it makes a man lie ingenuously.
Tartarin had killed only one lion and had sent the skin to Bravida.
The telegram had reached Tarascon two hours ahead of him.
The camel had preceded Tartarin without knowing it, covered with dust and sweat.
He added that the camel had seen him kill all his lions.
Thereupon the camel hobbled down the station stairs.
That is what brought the Tarasconians' joy to the climax.
Tartarin calmly directed his steps toward his house, followed by his fellow-countrymen.
Tartarin, red with happiness, began the tale of his hunt dix.
The Caphunters took his arm familiarly.
